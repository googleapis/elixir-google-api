  &#x60;TestCase&#x60; messages provide the request context and an expectation as to whether the given context will be allowed or denied. Test cases may specify the &#x60;request&#x60;, &#x60;resource&#x60;, and &#x60;function_mocks&#x60; to mock a function call to a service-provided function.  The &#x60;request&#x60; object represents context present at request-time.  The &#x60;resource&#x60; is the value of the target resource as it appears in persistent storage before the request is executed.
