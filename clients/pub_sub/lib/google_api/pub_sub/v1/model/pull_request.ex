defmodule GoogleApi.PubSub.V1.Model.PullRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  Request for the `Pull` method.

  ## Attributes

  *   `maxMessages` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - The maximum number of messages returned for this request. The Pub/Sub
      system may return fewer than the number specified.
  *   `returnImmediately` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - If this field set to true, the system will respond immediately even if
      it there are no messages available to return in the `Pull` response.
      Otherwise, the system may wait (for a bounded amount of time) until at
      least one message is available, rather than returning no messages.
