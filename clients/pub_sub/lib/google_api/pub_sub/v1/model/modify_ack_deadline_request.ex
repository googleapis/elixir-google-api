defmodule GoogleApi.PubSub.V1.Model.ModifyAckDeadlineRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  Request for the ModifyAckDeadline method.

  ## Attributes

  - ackDeadlineSeconds (integer()): The new ack deadline with respect to the time this request was sent to the Pub/Sub system. For example, if the value is 10, the new ack deadline will expire 10 seconds after the &#x60;ModifyAckDeadline&#x60; call was made. Specifying zero may immediately make the message available for another pull request. The minimum deadline you can specify is 0 seconds. The maximum deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes). Defaults to: `null`.
  - ackIds ([String.t]): List of acknowledgment IDs. Defaults to: `null`.
