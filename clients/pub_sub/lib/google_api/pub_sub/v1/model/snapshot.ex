defmodule GoogleApi.PubSub.V1.Model.Snapshot do
  @moduledoc """
  A snapshot resource. Snapshots are used in
  <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview">Seek</a>
  operations, which allow
  you to manage message acknowledgments in bulk. That is, you can set the
  acknowledgment state of messages in an existing subscription to the state
  captured by a snapshot.

  ## Attributes

  *   `expireTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The snapshot is guaranteed to exist up until this time.
      A newly-created snapshot expires no later than 7 days from the time of its
      creation. Its exact lifetime is determined at creation by the existing
      backlog in the source subscription. Specifically, the lifetime of the
      snapshot is `7 days - (age of oldest unacked message in the subscription)`.
      For example, consider a subscription whose oldest unacked message is 3 days
      old. If a snapshot is created from this subscription, the snapshot -- which
      will always capture this 3-day-old backlog as long as the snapshot
      exists -- will expire in 4 days. The service will refuse to create a
      snapshot that would expire in less than 1 hour after creation.
  *   `labels` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - See <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/labels"> Creating and
      managing labels</a>.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The name of the snapshot.
  *   `topic` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The name of the topic from which this snapshot is retaining messages.
