  ## Attributes

  *   `allowedPersistenceRegions` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - A list of IDs of GCP regions where messages that are published to the topic
      may be persisted in storage. Messages published by publishers running in
      non-allowed GCP regions (or running outside of GCP altogether) will be
      routed for storage in one of the allowed regions. An empty list means that
      no regions are allowed, and is not a valid configuration.
