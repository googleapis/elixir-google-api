defmodule GoogleApi.PubSub.V1.Model.ReceivedMessage do
  @moduledoc """
  A message and its corresponding acknowledgment ID.

  ## Attributes

  *   `ackId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - This ID can be used to acknowledge the received message.
  *   `deliveryAttempt` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Delivery attempt counter is 1 + (the sum of number of NACKs and number of
      ack_deadline exceeds) for this message.

      A NACK is any call to ModifyAckDeadline with a 0 deadline. An ack_deadline
      exceeds event is whenever a message is not acknowledged within
      ack_deadline. Note that ack_deadline is initially
      Subscription.ackDeadlineSeconds, but may get extended automatically by
      the client library.

      The first delivery of a given message will have this value as 1. The value
      is calculated at best effort and is approximate.

      If a DeadLetterPolicy is not set on the subscription, this will be 0.
      <b>EXPERIMENTAL:</b> This feature is part of a closed alpha release. This
      API might be changed in backward-incompatible ways and is not recommended
      for production use. It is not subject to any SLA or deprecation policy.
  *   `message` (*type:* `GoogleApi.PubSub.V1.Model.PubsubMessage.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The message.
