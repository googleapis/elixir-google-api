defmodule GoogleApi.NetworkConnectivity.V1.Model.AutoAccept do
  @moduledoc """
  The auto-accept setting for a group controls whether proposed spokes are automatically attached to the hub. If auto-accept is enabled, the spoke immediately is attached to the hub and becomes part of the group. In this case, the new spoke is in the ACTIVE state. If auto-accept is disabled, the spoke goes to the INACTIVE state, and it must be reviewed and accepted by a hub administrator.

  ## Attributes

  *   `autoAcceptProjects` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. A list of project ids or project numbers for which you want to enable auto-accept. The auto-accept setting is applied to spokes being created or updated in these projects.
