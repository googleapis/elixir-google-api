defmodule GoogleApi.NetworkConnectivity.V1.Model.ConsumerPscConfig do
  @moduledoc """
  Allow the producer to specify which consumers can connect to it.

  ## Attributes

  *   `consumerInstanceProject` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The project ID or project number of the consumer project. This project is the one that the consumer uses to interact with the producer instance. From the perspective of a consumer who's created a producer instance, this is the project of the producer instance. Format: 'projects/' Eg. 'projects/consumer-project' or 'projects/1234'
  *   `disableGlobalAccess` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control whether the PSC endpoint can be accessed from another region.
  *   `network` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The resource path of the consumer network where PSC connections are allowed to be created in. Note, this network does not need be in the ConsumerPscConfig.project in the case of SharedVPC. Example: projects/{projectNumOrId}/global/networks/{networkId}.
  *   `producerInstanceId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Immutable. An immutable identifier for the producer instance.
  *   `project` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The consumer project where PSC connections are allowed to be created in.
  *   `serviceAttachmentIpAddressMap` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. A map to store mapping between customer vip and target service attachment. Only service attachment with producer specified ip addresses are stored here.
  *   `state` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. Overall state of PSC Connections management for this consumer psc config.
