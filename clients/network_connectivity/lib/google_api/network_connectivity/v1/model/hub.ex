defmodule GoogleApi.NetworkConnectivity.V1.Model.Hub do
  @moduledoc """
  A Network Connectivity Center hub is a global management resource to which you attach spokes. A single hub can contain spokes from multiple regions. However, if any of a hub's spokes use the site-to-site data transfer feature, the resources associated with those spokes must all be in the same VPC network. Spokes that do not use site-to-site data transfer can be associated with any VPC network in your project.

  ## Attributes

  *   `createTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The time the hub was created.
  *   `description` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - An optional description of the hub.
  *   `labels` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional labels in key-value pair format. For more information about labels, see [Requirements for labels](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-labels#requirements).
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Immutable. The name of the hub. Hub names must be unique. They use the following form: `projects/{project_number}/locations/global/hubs/{hub_id}`
  *   `routeTables` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The route tables that belong to this hub. They use the following form: `projects/{project_number}/locations/global/hubs/{hub_id}/routeTables/{route_table_id}` This field is read-only. Network Connectivity Center automatically populates it based on the route tables nested under the hub.
  *   `routingVpcs` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.NetworkConnectivity.V1.Model.RoutingVPC.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The VPC networks associated with this hub's spokes. This field is read-only. Network Connectivity Center automatically populates it based on the set of spokes attached to the hub.
  *   `spokeSummary` (*type:* `GoogleApi.NetworkConnectivity.V1.Model.SpokeSummary.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. A summary of the spokes associated with a hub. The summary includes a count of spokes according to type and according to state. If any spokes are inactive, the summary also lists the reasons they are inactive, including a count for each reason.
  *   `state` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The current lifecycle state of this hub.
  *   `uniqueId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The Google-generated UUID for the hub. This value is unique across all hub resources. If a hub is deleted and another with the same name is created, the new hub is assigned a different unique_id.
  *   `updateTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The time the hub was last updated.
