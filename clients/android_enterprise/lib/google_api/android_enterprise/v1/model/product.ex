defmodule GoogleApi.AndroidEnterprise.V1.Model.Product do
  @moduledoc """
  A Products resource represents an app in the Google Play store that is available to at least some users in the enterprise. (Some apps are restricted to a single enterprise, and no information about them is made available outside that enterprise.)  The information provided for each product (localized name, icon, link to the full Google Play details page) is intended to allow a basic representation of the product within an EMM user interface.

  ## Attributes

  - appVersion ([AppVersion]): App versions currently available for this product. Defaults to: `null`.
  - authorName (String.t): The name of the author of the product (for example, the app developer). Defaults to: `null`.
  - availableCountries ([String.t]): The countries which this app is available in. Defaults to: `null`.
  - availableTracks ([String.t]): The tracks that are visible to the enterprise. Defaults to: `null`.
  - category (String.t): The app category (e.g. RACING, SOCIAL, etc.) Defaults to: `null`.

  - description (String.t): The localized promotional description, if available. Defaults to: `null`.
  - detailsUrl (String.t): A link to the (consumer) Google Play details page for the product. Defaults to: `null`.
  - distributionChannel (String.t): How and to whom the package is made available. The value publicGoogleHosted means that the package is available through the Play store and not restricted to a specific enterprise. The value privateGoogleHosted means that the package is a private app (restricted to an enterprise) but hosted by Google. The value privateSelfHosted means that the package is a private app (restricted to an enterprise) and is privately hosted. Defaults to: `null`.
