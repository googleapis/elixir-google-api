defmodule GoogleApi.MyBusinessVerifications.V1.Model.Location do
  @moduledoc """
  A subset of location info. See the [help center article] (https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038177) for a detailed description of these fields, or the [category endpoint](/my-business/reference/rest/v4/categories) for a list of valid business categories.

  ## Attributes

  *   `address` (*type:* `GoogleApi.MyBusinessVerifications.V1.Model.PostalAddress.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. A precise, accurate address to describe your business location. PO boxes or mailboxes located at remote locations are not acceptable. At this time, you can specify a maximum of five `address_lines` values in the address.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. Location name should reflect your business's real-world name, as used consistently on your storefront, website, and stationery, and as known to customers. Any additional information, when relevant, can be included in other fields of the resource (for example, `Address`, `Categories`). Don't add unnecessary information to your name (for example, prefer "Google" over "Google Inc. - Mountain View Corporate Headquarters"). Don't include marketing taglines, store codes, special characters, hours or closed/open status, phone numbers, website URLs, service/product information, location/address or directions, or containment information (for example, "Chase ATM in Duane Reade").
  *   `primaryCategoryId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. Id of the category that best describes the core business this location engages in.
  *   `primaryPhone` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. A phone number that connects to your individual business location as directly as possible. Use a local phone number instead of a central, call center helpline number whenever possible.
  *   `websiteUri` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. A URL for this business. If possible, use a URL that represents this individual business location instead of a generic website/URL that represents all locations, or the brand.
