defmodule GoogleApi.CloudResourceManager.V1.Model.Constraint do
  @moduledoc """
  A `Constraint` describes a way in which a resource's configuration can be
  restricted. For example, it controls which cloud services can be activated
  across an organization, or whether a Compute Engine instance can have
  serial port connections established. `Constraints` can be configured by the
  organization's policy adminstrator to fit the needs of the organzation by
  setting Policies for `Constraints` at different locations in the
  organization's resource hierarchy. Policies are inherited down the resource
  hierarchy from higher levels, but can also be overridden. For details about
  the inheritance rules please read about
  Policies.

  `Constraints` have a default behavior determined by the `constraint_default`
  field, which is the enforcement behavior that is used in the absence of a
  `Policy` being defined or inherited for the resource in question.

  ## Attributes

  - booleanConstraint (GoogleApi.CloudResourceManager.V1.Model.BooleanConstraint.t): Defines this constraint as being a BooleanConstraint. Defaults to `nil`.
  - constraintDefault (String.t): The evaluation behavior of this constraint in the absense of 'Policy'. Defaults to `nil`.
  - description (String.t): Detailed description of what this `Constraint` controls as well as how and
  where it is enforced.

  Mutable. Defaults to `nil`.
  - displayName (String.t): The human readable name.

  Mutable. Defaults to `nil`.
  - listConstraint (GoogleApi.CloudResourceManager.V1.Model.ListConstraint.t): Defines this constraint as being a ListConstraint. Defaults to `nil`.
  - name (String.t): Immutable value, required to globally be unique. For example,
  `constraints/serviceuser.services` Defaults to `nil`.
  - version (integer()): Version of the `Constraint`. Default version is 0; Defaults to `nil`.
