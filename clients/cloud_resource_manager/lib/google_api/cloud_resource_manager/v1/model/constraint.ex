defmodule GoogleApi.CloudResourceManager.V1.Model.Constraint do
  @moduledoc """
  A &#x60;Constraint&#x60; describes a way in which a resource&#39;s configuration can be restricted. For example, it controls which cloud services can be activated across an organization, or whether a Compute Engine instance can have serial port connections established. &#x60;Constraints&#x60; can be configured by the organization&#39;s policy adminstrator to fit the needs of the organzation by setting Policies for &#x60;Constraints&#x60; at different locations in the organization&#39;s resource hierarchy. Policies are inherited down the resource hierarchy from higher levels, but can also be overridden. For details about the inheritance rules please read about Policies.  &#x60;Constraints&#x60; have a default behavior determined by the &#x60;constraint_default&#x60; field, which is the enforcement behavior that is used in the absence of a &#x60;Policy&#x60; being defined or inherited for the resource in question.
