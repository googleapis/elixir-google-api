defmodule GoogleApi.CloudResourceManager.V1.Model.BooleanPolicy do
  @moduledoc """
  Used in `policy_type` to specify how `boolean_policy` will behave at this
  resource.

  ## Attributes

  *   `enforced` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - If `true`, then the `Policy` is enforced. If `false`, then any
      configuration is acceptable.

      Suppose you have a `Constraint`
      `constraints/compute.disableSerialPortAccess` with `constraint_default`
      set to `ALLOW`. A `Policy` for that `Constraint` exhibits the following
      behavior:
        - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `false`, serial
          port connection attempts will be allowed.
        - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `true`, serial
          port connection attempts will be refused.
        - If the `Policy` at this resource is `RestoreDefault`, serial port
          connection attempts will be allowed.
        - If no `Policy` is set at this resource or anywhere higher in the
          resource hierarchy, serial port connection attempts will be allowed.
        - If no `Policy` is set at this resource, but one exists higher in the
          resource hierarchy, the behavior is as if the`Policy` were set at
          this resource.

      The following examples demonstrate the different possible layerings:

      Example 1 (nearest `Constraint` wins):
        `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with:
          {enforced: false}
        `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set.
      The constraint at `projects/bar` and `organizations/foo` will not be
      enforced.

      Example 2 (enforcement gets replaced):
        `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with:
          {enforced: false}
        `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:
          {enforced: true}
      The constraint at `organizations/foo` is not enforced.
      The constraint at `projects/bar` is enforced.

      Example 3 (RestoreDefault):
        `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with:
          {enforced: true}
        `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:
          {RestoreDefault: {}}
      The constraint at `organizations/foo` is enforced.
      The constraint at `projects/bar` is not enforced, because
      `constraint_default` for the `Constraint` is `ALLOW`.
