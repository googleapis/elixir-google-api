defmodule GoogleApi.Slides.V1.Model.DuplicateObjectRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  Duplicates a slide or page element.

  When duplicating a slide, the duplicate slide will be created immediately
  following the specified slide. When duplicating a page element, the duplicate
  will be placed on the same page at the same position as the original.

  ## Attributes

  - objectId (String.t): The ID of the object to duplicate. Defaults to `nil`.
  - objectIds (map()): The object being duplicated may contain other objects, for example when
  duplicating a slide or a group page element. This map defines how the IDs
  of duplicated objects are generated: the keys are the IDs of the original
  objects and its values are the IDs that will be assigned to the
  corresponding duplicate object. The ID of the source object's duplicate
  may be specified in this map as well, using the same value of the
  `object_id` field as a key and the newly desired ID as the value.

  All keys must correspond to existing IDs in the presentation. All values
  must be unique in the presentation and must start with an alphanumeric
  character or an underscore (matches regex `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`); remaining
  characters may include those as well as a hyphen or colon (matches regex
  `[a-zA-Z0-9_-:]`). The length of the new ID must not be less than 5 or
  greater than 50.

  If any IDs of source objects are omitted from the map, a new random ID will
  be assigned. If the map is empty or unset, all duplicate objects will
  receive a new random ID. Defaults to `nil`.
