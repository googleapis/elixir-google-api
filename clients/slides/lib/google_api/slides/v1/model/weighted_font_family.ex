defmodule GoogleApi.Slides.V1.Model.WeightedFontFamily do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents a font family and weight used to style a TextRun.

  ## Attributes

  - fontFamily (String.t): The font family of the text.

  The font family can be any font from the Font menu in Slides or from
  [Google Fonts] (https://fonts.google.com/). If the font name is
  unrecognized, the text is rendered in `Arial`. Defaults to `nil`.
  - weight (integer()): The rendered weight of the text. This field can have any value that is a
  multiple of `100` between `100` and `900`, inclusive. This range
  corresponds to the numerical values described in the CSS 2.1
  Specification,
  [section 15.6](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/fonts.html#font-boldness),
  with non-numerical values disallowed. Weights greater than or equal to
  `700` are considered bold, and weights less than `700`are not bold. The
  default value is `400` ("normal"). Defaults to `nil`.
