defmodule GoogleApi.Slides.V1.Model.LineConnection do
  @moduledoc """
  The properties for one end of a Line
  connection.

  ## Attributes

  - connectedObjectId (String.t): The object ID of the connected page element.

  Some page elements, such as groups, tables, and lines
  do not have connection sites and therefore cannot be connected to a
  connector line. Defaults to `nil`.
  - connectionSiteIndex (integer()): The index of the connection site on the connected page element.

  In most cases, it corresponds to the predefined connection site index from
  the ECMA-376 standard. More information on those connection sites can be
  found in the description of the "cnx" attribute in section 20.1.9.9 and
  Annex H. "Predefined DrawingML Shape and Text Geometries" of "Office Open
  XML File Formats-Fundamentals and Markup Language Reference", part 1 of
  [ECMA-376 5th edition]
  (http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm).

  The position of each connection site can also be viewed from Slides editor. Defaults to `nil`.
