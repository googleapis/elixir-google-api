defmodule GoogleApi.Slides.V1.Model.Autofit do
  @moduledoc """
  The autofit properties of a Shape.

  ## Attributes

  *   `autofitType` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The autofit type of the shape. If unspecified, the autofit type is inherited from a parent placeholder if it exists. The field will be automatically set to NONE if a request is made that may affect text fitting within its bounding text box. In this case the font_scale will be applied to the font_size and the line_spacing_reduction will be applied to the line_spacing. Both properties would also be reset to default values.
  *   `fontScale` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - The font scale applied to the shape. For shapes with autofit_type NONE or SHAPE_AUTOFIT, this value will be the default value of 1. For TEXT_AUTOFIT, this value multiplied by the font_size will give the font size that is rendered in the editor. This property is read-only.
  *   `lineSpacingReduction` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - The line spacing reduction applied to the shape. For shapes with autofit_type NONE or SHAPE_AUTOFIT, this value will be the default value of 0. For TEXT_AUTOFIT, this value subtracted from the line_spacing will give the line spacing that is rendered in the editor. This property is read-only.
