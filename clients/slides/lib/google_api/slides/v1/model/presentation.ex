defmodule GoogleApi.Slides.V1.Model.Presentation do
  @moduledoc """
  A Google Slides presentation.

  ## Attributes

  - layouts (list(GoogleApi.Slides.V1.Model.Page.t)): The layouts in the presentation. A layout is a template that determines
  how content is arranged and styled on the slides that inherit from that
  layout. Defaults to `nil`.
  - locale (String.t): The locale of the presentation, as an IETF BCP 47 language tag. Defaults to `nil`.
  - masters (list(GoogleApi.Slides.V1.Model.Page.t)): The slide masters in the presentation. A slide master contains all common
  page elements and the common properties for a set of layouts. They serve
  three purposes:

  - Placeholder shapes on a master contain the default text styles and shape
  properties of all placeholder shapes on pages that use that master.
  - The master page properties define the common page properties inherited by
  its layouts.
  - Any other shapes on the master slide will appear on all slides using that
  master, regardless of their layout. Defaults to `nil`.
  - notesMaster (GoogleApi.Slides.V1.Model.Page.t): The notes master in the presentation. It serves three purposes:

  - Placeholder shapes on a notes master contain the default text styles and
  shape properties of all placeholder shapes on notes pages. Specifically,
  a `SLIDE_IMAGE` placeholder shape contains the slide thumbnail, and a
  `BODY` placeholder shape contains the speaker notes.
  - The notes master page properties define the common page properties
  inherited by all notes pages.
  - Any other shapes on the notes master will appear on all notes pages.

  The notes master is read-only. Defaults to `nil`.
  - pageSize (GoogleApi.Slides.V1.Model.Size.t): The size of pages in the presentation. Defaults to `nil`.
  - presentationId (String.t): The ID of the presentation. Defaults to `nil`.
  - revisionId (String.t): The revision ID of the presentation. Can be used in update requests
  to assert that the presentation revision hasn't changed since the last
  read operation. Only populated if the user has edit access to the
  presentation.

  The format of the revision ID may change over time, so it should be treated
  opaquely. A returned revision ID is only guaranteed to be valid for 24
  hours after it has been returned and cannot be shared across users. If the
  revision ID is unchanged between calls, then the presentation has not
  changed. Conversely, a changed ID (for the same presentation and user)
  usually means the presentation has been updated; however, a changed ID can
  also be due to internal factors such as ID format changes. Defaults to `nil`.
  - slides (list(GoogleApi.Slides.V1.Model.Page.t)): The slides in the presentation.
  A slide inherits properties from a slide layout. Defaults to `nil`.
  - title (String.t): The title of the presentation. Defaults to `nil`.
