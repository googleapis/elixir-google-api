# GoogleApi.Vault

Google Vault API client library.

Retention and eDiscovery for Google Workspace. To work with Vault resources, the account must have the [required Vault privileges](https://support.google.com/vault/answer/2799699) and access to the matter. To access a matter, the account must have created the matter, have the matter shared with them, or have the **View All Matters** privilege. For example, to download an export, an account needs the **Manage Exports** privilege and the matter shared with them.
