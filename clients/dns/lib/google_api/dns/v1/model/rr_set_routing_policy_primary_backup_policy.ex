defmodule GoogleApi.DNS.V1.Model.RRSetRoutingPolicyPrimaryBackupPolicy do
  @moduledoc """
  Configures a RRSetRoutingPolicy such that all queries are responded with the primary_targets if they are healthy. And if all of them are unhealthy, then we fallback to a geo localized policy.

  ## Attributes

  *   `backupGeoTargets` (*type:* `GoogleApi.DNS.V1.Model.RRSetRoutingPolicyGeoPolicy.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Backup targets provide a regional failover policy for the otherwise global primary targets. If serving state is set to BACKUP, this policy essentially becomes a geo routing policy.
  *   `kind` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `dns#rRSetRoutingPolicyPrimaryBackupPolicy`) - 
  *   `primaryTargets` (*type:* `GoogleApi.DNS.V1.Model.RRSetRoutingPolicyHealthCheckTargets.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Endpoints that are health checked before making the routing decision. Unhealthy endpoints are omitted from the results. If all endpoints are unhealthy, we serve a response based on the backup_geo_targets.
  *   `trickleTraffic` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - When serving state is PRIMARY, this field provides the option of sending a small percentage of the traffic to the backup targets.
