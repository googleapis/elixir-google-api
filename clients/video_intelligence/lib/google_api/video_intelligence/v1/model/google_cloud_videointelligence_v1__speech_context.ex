defmodule GoogleApi.VideoIntelligence.V1.Model.GoogleCloudVideointelligenceV1_SpeechContext do

  Provides "hints" to the speech recognizer to favor specific words and phrases
  in the results.

  ## Attributes

  *   `phrases` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. A list of strings containing words and phrases "hints" so that
      the speech recognition is more likely to recognize them. This can be used
      to improve the accuracy for specific words and phrases, for example, if
      specific commands are typically spoken by the user. This can also be used
      to add additional words to the vocabulary of the recognizer. See
      [usage limits](https://cloud.google.com/speech/limits#content).
