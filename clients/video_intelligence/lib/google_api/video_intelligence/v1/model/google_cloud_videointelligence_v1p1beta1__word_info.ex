defmodule GoogleApi.VideoIntelligence.V1.Model.GoogleCloudVideointelligenceV1p1beta1_WordInfo do
  @moduledoc """
  Word-specific information for recognized words. Word information is only
  included in the response when certain request parameters are set, such
  as `enable_word_time_offsets`.

  ## Attributes

  *   `confidence` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The confidence estimate between 0.0 and 1.0. A higher number
      indicates an estimated greater likelihood that the recognized words are
      correct. This field is set only for the top alternative.
      This field is not guaranteed to be accurate and users should not rely on it
      to be always provided.
      The default of 0.0 is a sentinel value indicating `confidence` was not set.
  *   `endTime` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Time offset relative to the beginning of the audio, and
      corresponding to the end of the spoken word. This field is only set if
      `enable_word_time_offsets=true` and only in the top hypothesis. This is an
      experimental feature and the accuracy of the time offset can vary.
  *   `speakerTag` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. A distinct integer value is assigned for every speaker within
      the audio. This field specifies which one of those speakers was detected to
      have spoken this word. Value ranges from 1 up to diarization_speaker_count,
      and is only set if speaker diarization is enabled.
  *   `startTime` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Time offset relative to the beginning of the audio, and
      corresponding to the start of the spoken word. This field is only set if
      `enable_word_time_offsets=true` and only in the top hypothesis. This is an
      experimental feature and the accuracy of the time offset can vary.
  *   `word` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The word corresponding to this set of information.
