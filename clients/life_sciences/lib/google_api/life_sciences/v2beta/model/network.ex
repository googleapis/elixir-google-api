defmodule GoogleApi.LifeSciences.V2beta.Model.Network do
  @moduledoc """
  VM networking options.

  ## Attributes

  *   `network` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The network name to attach the VM's network interface to. The value will
      be prefixed with `global/networks/` unless it contains a `/`, in which
      case it is assumed to be a fully specified network resource URL.

      If unspecified, the global default network is used.
  *   `subnetwork` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - If the specified network is configured for custom subnet creation, the
      name of the subnetwork to attach the instance to must be specified here.

      The value is prefixed with `regions/*/subnetworks/` unless it contains a
      `/`, in which case it is assumed to be a fully specified subnetwork
      resource URL.

      If the `*` character appears in the value, it is replaced with the region
      that the virtual machine has been allocated in.
  *   `usePrivateAddress` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - If set to true, do not attach a public IP address to the VM. Note that
      without a public IP address, additional configuration is required to
      allow the VM to access Google services.

      See https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access
      for more information.
