defmodule GoogleApi.LifeSciences.V2beta.Model.Disk do
  @moduledoc """
  Carries information about a disk that can be attached to a VM. See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/performance for more information about disk type, size, and performance considerations.

  ## Attributes

  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A user-supplied name for the disk. Used when mounting the disk into actions. The name must contain only upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens and cannot start with a hyphen.
  *   `sizeGb` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - The size, in GB, of the disk to attach. If the size is not specified, a default is chosen to ensure reasonable I/O performance. If the disk type is specified as `local-ssd`, multiple local drives are automatically combined to provide the requested size. Note, however, that each physical SSD is 375GB in size, and no more than 8 drives can be attached to a single instance.
  *   `sourceImage` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - An optional image to put on the disk before attaching it to the VM.
  *   `type` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The Compute Engine disk type. If unspecified, `pd-standard` is used.
