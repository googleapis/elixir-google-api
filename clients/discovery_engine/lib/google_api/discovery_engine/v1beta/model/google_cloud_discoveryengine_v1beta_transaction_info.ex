  A transaction represents the entire purchase transaction.

  ## Attributes

  *   `cost` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - All the costs associated with the products. These can be manufacturing costs, shipping expenses not borne by the end user, or any other costs, such that: * Profit = value - tax - cost
  *   `currency` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. Currency code. Use three-character ISO-4217 code.
  *   `discountValue` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - The total discount(s) value applied to this transaction. This figure should be excluded from TransactionInfo.value For example, if a user paid TransactionInfo.value amount, then nominal (pre-discount) value of the transaction is the sum of TransactionInfo.value and TransactionInfo.discount_value This means that profit is calculated the same way, regardless of the discount value, and that TransactionInfo.discount_value can be larger than TransactionInfo.value: * Profit = value - tax - cost
  *   `tax` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - All the taxes associated with the transaction.
  *   `transactionId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The transaction ID with a length limit of 128 characters.
  *   `value` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. Total non-zero value associated with the transaction. This value may include shipping, tax, or other adjustments to the total value that you want to include.
