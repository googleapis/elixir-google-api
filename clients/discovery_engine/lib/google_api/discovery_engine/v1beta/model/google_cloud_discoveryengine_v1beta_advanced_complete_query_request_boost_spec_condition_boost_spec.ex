defmodule GoogleApi.DiscoveryEngine.V1beta.Model.GoogleCloudDiscoveryengineV1betaAdvancedCompleteQueryRequestBoostSpecConditionBoostSpec do
  @moduledoc """
  Boost applies to suggestions which match a condition.

  ## Attributes

  *   `boost` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - Strength of the boost, which should be in [-1, 1]. Negative boost means demotion. Default is 0.0. Setting to 1.0 gives the suggestions a big promotion. However, it does not necessarily mean that the top result will be a boosted suggestion. Setting to -1.0 gives the suggestions a big demotion. However, other suggestions that are relevant might still be shown. Setting to 0.0 means no boost applied. The boosting condition is ignored.
  *   `condition` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - An expression which specifies a boost condition. The syntax is the same as [filter expression syntax](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/filter-search-metadata#filter-expression-syntax). Currently, the only supported condition is a list of BCP-47 lang codes. Example: * To boost suggestions in languages `en` or `fr`: `(lang_code: ANY("en", "fr"))`
