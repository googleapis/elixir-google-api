defmodule GoogleApi.DiscoveryEngine.V1.Model.GoogleApiDistributionBucketOptionsExplicit do
  @moduledoc """
  Specifies a set of buckets with arbitrary widths. There are `size(bounds) + 1` (= N) buckets. Bucket `i` has the following boundaries: Upper bound (0 <= i < N-1): bounds[i] Lower bound (1 <= i < N); bounds[i - 1] The `bounds` field must contain at least one element. If `bounds` has only one element, then there are no finite buckets, and that single element is the common boundary of the overflow and underflow buckets.

  ## Attributes

  *   `bounds` (*type:* `list(float())`, *default:* `nil`) - The values must be monotonically increasing.
