defmodule GoogleApi.NetworkServices.V1.Model.ExtensionChainExtension do
  @moduledoc """
  A single extension in the chain to execute for the matching request.

  ## Attributes

  *   `authority` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. The `:authority` header in the gRPC request sent from Envoy to the extension service. Required for Callout extensions. This field is not supported for plugin extensions and must not be set.
  *   `failOpen` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. Determines how the proxy behaves if the call to the extension fails or times out. When set to `TRUE`, request or response processing continues without error. Any subsequent extensions in the extension chain are also executed. When set to `FALSE` or the default setting of `FALSE` is used, one of the following happens: * If response headers have not been delivered to the downstream client, a generic 500 error is returned to the client. The error response can be tailored by configuring a custom error response in the load balancer. * If response headers have been delivered, then the HTTP stream to the downstream client is reset.
  *   `forwardHeaders` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. List of the HTTP headers to forward to the extension (from the client or backend). If omitted, all headers are sent. Each element is a string indicating the header name.
  *   `metadata` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. The metadata provided here is included as part of the `metadata_context` (of type `google.protobuf.Struct`) in the `ProcessingRequest` message sent to the extension server. The metadata is available under the namespace `com.google....`. For example: `com.google.lb_traffic_extension.lbtrafficextension1.chain1.ext1`. The following variables are supported in the metadata: `{forwarding_rule_id}` - substituted with the forwarding rule's fully qualified resource name. This field is not supported for plugin extensions and must not be set.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The name for this extension. The name is logged as part of the HTTP request logs. The name must conform with RFC-1034, is restricted to lower-cased letters, numbers and hyphens, and can have a maximum length of 63 characters. Additionally, the first character must be a letter and the last a letter or a number.
  *   `service` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The reference to the service that runs the extension. Currently only callout extensions are supported here. To configure a callout extension, `service` must be a fully-qualified reference to a [backend service](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/backendServices) in the format: `https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/regions/{region}/backendServices/{backendService}` or `https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/global/backendServices/{backendService}`. To configure a plugin extension, this must be a reference to a [wasm plugin](https://cloud.google.com/service-extensions/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.wasmPlugins) in the format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/wasmPlugins/{plugin}` or `//networkservices.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/wasmPlugins/{wasmPlugin}`.
  *   `supportedEvents` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. A set of events during request or response processing for which this extension is called. This field is required for the `LbTrafficExtension` resource. It must not be set for the `LbRouteExtension` resource.
  *   `timeout` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. Specifies the timeout for each individual message on the stream. The timeout must be between 10-1000 milliseconds. Required for callout extensions. This field is not supported for plugin extensions and must not be set.
