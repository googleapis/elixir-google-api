defmodule GoogleApi.NetworkServices.V1.Model.TlsRouteRouteMatch do
  @moduledoc """
  RouteMatch defines the predicate used to match requests to a given action. Multiple match types are "AND"ed for evaluation. If no routeMatch field is specified, this rule will unconditionally match traffic.

  ## Attributes

  *   `alpn` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation) to match against. Examples: "http/1.1", "h2". At least one of sni_host and alpn is required. Up to 5 alpns across all matches can be set.
  *   `sniHost` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. SNI (server name indicator) to match against. SNI will be matched against all wildcard domains, i.e. www.example.com will be first matched against www.example.com, then *.example.com, then *.com. Partial wildcards are not supported, and values like *w.example.com are invalid. At least one of sni_host and alpn is required. Up to 5 sni hosts across all matches can be set.
