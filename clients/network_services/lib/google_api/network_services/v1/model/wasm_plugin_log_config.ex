defmodule GoogleApi.NetworkServices.V1.Model.WasmPluginLogConfig do
  @moduledoc """
  Specifies the logging options for the activity performed by this `WasmPlugin`. If logging is enabled, plugin logs are exported to Cloud Logging.

  ## Attributes

  *   `enable` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. Specifies whether to enable logging for activity by this `WasmPlugin`. Defaults to `false`.
  *   `minLogLevel` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Non-empty default. Specificies the lowest level of the plugin logs that are exported to Cloud Logging. This setting relates to the logs generated by using logging statements in your Wasm code. This field is can be set only if logging is enabled for the `WasmPlugin` resource. If the field is not provided when logging is enabled, it is set to `INFO` by default.
  *   `sampleRate` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - Non-empty default. Configures the sampling rate of activity logs, where `1.0` means all logged activity is reported and `0.0` means no activity is reported. A floating point value between `0.0` and `1.0` indicates that a percentage of log messages is stored. The default value when logging is enabled is `1.0`. The value of the field must be between `0` and `1` (inclusive). This field can only be specified if logging is enabled for this `WasmPlugin`.
