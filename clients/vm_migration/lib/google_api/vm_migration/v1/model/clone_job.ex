defmodule GoogleApi.VMMigration.V1.Model.CloneJob do
  @moduledoc """
  CloneJob describes the process of creating a clone of a MigratingVM to the requested target based on the latest successful uploaded snapshots. While the migration cycles of a MigratingVm take place, it is possible to verify the uploaded VM can be started in the cloud, by creating a clone. The clone can be created without any downtime, and it is created using the latest snapshots which are already in the cloud. The cloneJob is only responsible for its work, not its products, which means once it is finished, it will never touch the instance it created. It will only delete it in case of the CloneJob being cancelled or upon failure to clone.

  ## Attributes

  *   `computeEngineTargetDetails` (*type:* `GoogleApi.VMMigration.V1.Model.ComputeEngineTargetDetails.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. Details of the target VM in Compute Engine.
  *   `createTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The time the clone job was created (as an API call, not when it was actually created in the target).
  *   `endTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The time the clone job was ended.
  *   `error` (*type:* `GoogleApi.VMMigration.V1.Model.Status.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. Provides details for the errors that led to the Clone Job's state.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The name of the clone.
  *   `state` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. State of the clone job.
  *   `stateTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The time the state was last updated.
