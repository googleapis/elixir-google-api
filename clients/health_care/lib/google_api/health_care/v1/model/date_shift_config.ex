defmodule GoogleApi.HealthCare.V1.Model.DateShiftConfig do
  @moduledoc """
  Shift a date forward or backward in time by a random amount which is consistent for a given patient and crypto key combination.

  ## Attributes

  *   `cryptoKey` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - An AES 128/192/256 bit key. Causes the shift to be computed based on this key and the patient ID. A default key is generated for each de-identification operation and is used when neither `crypto_key` nor `kms_wrapped` is specified. Must not be set if `kms_wrapped` is set.
