defmodule GoogleApi.HealthCare.V1.Model.FieldMetadata do
  @moduledoc """
  Specifies FHIR paths to match, and how to handle de-identification of matching fields.

  ## Attributes

  *   `action` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Deidentify action for one field.
  *   `paths` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - List of paths to FHIR fields to be redacted. Each path is a period-separated list where each component is either a field name or FHIR type name, for example: Patient, HumanName. For "choice" types (those defined in the FHIR spec with the form: field[x]) we use two separate components. For example, "deceasedAge.unit" is matched by "Deceased.Age.unit". Supported types are: AdministrativeGenderCode, Code, Date, DateTime, Decimal, HumanName, Id, LanguageCode, Markdown, Oid, String, Uri, Uuid, Xhtml. Base64Binary is also supported, but may only be kept as-is or have all the content removed.
