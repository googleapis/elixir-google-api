  @moduledoc """
  A segment in a structured format.

  ## Attributes

  *   `fields` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - A mapping from the positional location to the value. The key string uses zero-based indexes separated by dots to identify Fields, components and sub-components. A bracket notation is also used to identify different instances of a repeated field. Regex for key: (\\d+)(\\[\\d+\\])?(.\\d+)?(.\\d+)? Examples of (key, value) pairs: * (0.1, "hemoglobin") denotes that the first component of Field 0 has the value "hemoglobin". * (1.1.2, "CBC") denotes that the second sub-component of the first component of Field 1 has the value "CBC". * (1[0].1, "HbA1c") denotes that the first component of the first Instance of Field 1, which is repeated, has the value "HbA1c".
  *   `segmentId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A string that indicates the type of segment. For example, EVN or PID.
  *   `setId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Set ID for segments that can be in a set. This can be empty if it's missing or isn't applicable.
