  The candidate entities that an entity mention could link to.

  ## Attributes

  *   `entityId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - entity_id is a first class field entity_id uniquely identifies this concept and its meta-vocabulary. For example, "UMLS/C0000970".
  *   `preferredTerm` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - preferred_term is the preferred term for this concept. For example, "Acetaminophen". For ad hoc entities formed by normalization, this is the most popular unnormalized string.
  *   `vocabularyCodes` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Vocabulary codes are first-class fields and differentiated from the concept unique identifier (entity_id). vocabulary_codes contains the representation of this concept in particular vocabularies, such as ICD-10, SNOMED-CT and RxNORM. These are prefixed by the name of the vocabulary, followed by the unique code within that vocabulary. For example, "RXNORM/A10334543".
