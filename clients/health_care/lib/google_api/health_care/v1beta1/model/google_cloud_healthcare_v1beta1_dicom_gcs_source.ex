  Specifies the configuration for importing data from Cloud Storage.

  ## Attributes

  *   `uri` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Points to a Cloud Storage URI containing file(s) with content only. The URI must be in the following format: `gs://{bucket_id}/{object_id}`. The URI can include wildcards in `object_id` and thus identify multiple files. Supported wildcards: '*' to match 0 or more non-separator characters '**' to match 0 or more characters (including separators). Must be used at the end of a path and with no other wildcards in the path. Can also be used with a file extension (such as .dcm), which imports all files with the extension in the specified directory and its sub-directories. For example, `gs://my-bucket/my-directory/**.dcm` imports all files with .dcm extensions in `my-directory/` and its sub-directories. '?' to match 1 character All other URI formats are invalid. Files matching the wildcard are expected to contain content only, no metadata.
