defmodule GoogleApi.HealthCare.V1beta1.Model.Image do
  @moduledoc """
  An image.

  ## Attributes

  *   `gcsUri` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Input only. Points to a Cloud Storage URI containing the image. The URI must be in the following format: `gs://{bucket_id}/{object_id}`. The Cloud Healthcare API service account must have the `roles/storage.objectViewer` Cloud IAM role for this Cloud Storage location. The image at this URI is copied to a Cloud Storage location managed by the Cloud Healthcare API. Responses to image fetching requests return the image in raw_bytes.
  *   `rawBytes` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Image content represented as a stream of bytes. This field is populated when returned in GetConsentArtifact response, but not included in CreateConsentArtifact and ListConsentArtifact response.
