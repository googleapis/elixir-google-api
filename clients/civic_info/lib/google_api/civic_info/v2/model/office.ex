defmodule GoogleApi.CivicInfo.V2.Model.Office do
  @moduledoc """
  Information about an Office held by one or more Officials.

  ## Attributes

  - divisionId (String.t): The OCD ID of the division with which this office is associated. Defaults to `nil`.
  - levels (list(String.t)): The levels of government of which this office is part. There may be more than one in cases where a jurisdiction effectively acts at two different levels of government; for example, the mayor of the District of Columbia acts at "locality" level, but also effectively at both "administrative-area-2" and "administrative-area-1". Defaults to `nil`.
  - name (String.t): The human-readable name of the office. Defaults to `nil`.
  - officialIndices (list(integer())): List of indices in the officials array of people who presently hold this office. Defaults to `nil`.
  - roles (list(String.t)): The roles which this office fulfills. Roles are not meant to be exhaustive, or to exactly specify the entire set of responsibilities of a given office, but are meant to be rough categories that are useful for general selection from or sorting of a list of offices. Defaults to `nil`.
  - sources (list(GoogleApi.CivicInfo.V2.Model.Source.t)): A list of sources for this office. If multiple sources are listed, the data has been aggregated from those sources. Defaults to `nil`.
