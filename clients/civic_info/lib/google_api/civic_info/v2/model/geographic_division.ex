defmodule GoogleApi.CivicInfo.V2.Model.GeographicDivision do
  @moduledoc """
  Describes a political geography.

  ## Attributes

  *   `alsoKnownAs` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Any other valid OCD IDs that refer to the same division.

      Because OCD IDs are meant to be human-readable and at least somewhat predictable, there are occasionally several identifiers for a single division. These identifiers are defined to be equivalent to one another, and one is always indicated as the primary identifier. The primary identifier will be returned in ocd_id above, and any other equivalent valid identifiers will be returned in this list.

      For example, if this division's OCD ID is ocd-division/country:us/district:dc, this will contain ocd-division/country:us/state:dc.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The name of the division.
  *   `officeIndices` (*type:* `list(integer())`, *default:* `nil`) - List of indices in the offices array, one for each office elected from this division. Will only be present if includeOffices was true (or absent) in the request.
