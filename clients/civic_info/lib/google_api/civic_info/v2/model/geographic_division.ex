  Describes a political geography.

  ## Attributes

  - alsoKnownAs ([String.t]): Any other valid OCD IDs that refer to the same division.  Because OCD IDs are meant to be human-readable and at least somewhat predictable, there are occasionally several identifiers for a single division. These identifiers are defined to be equivalent to one another, and one is always indicated as the primary identifier. The primary identifier will be returned in ocd_id above, and any other equivalent valid identifiers will be returned in this list.  For example, if this division&#39;s OCD ID is ocd-division/country:us/district:dc, this will contain ocd-division/country:us/state:dc. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): The name of the division. Defaults to: `null`.
  - officeIndices ([integer()]): List of indices in the offices array, one for each office elected from this division. Will only be present if includeOffices was true (or absent) in the request. Defaults to: `null`.
