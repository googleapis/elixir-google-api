defmodule GoogleApi.CivicInfo.V2.Model.DivisionSearchResult do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents a political geographic division that matches the requested query.

  ## Attributes

  *   `aliases` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Other Open Civic Data identifiers that refer to the same division -- for example, those that refer to other political divisions whose boundaries are defined to be coterminous with this one. For example, ocd-division/country:us/state:wy will include an alias of ocd-division/country:us/state:wy/cd:1, since Wyoming has only one Congressional district.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The name of the division.
  *   `ocdId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The unique Open Civic Data identifier for this division.
