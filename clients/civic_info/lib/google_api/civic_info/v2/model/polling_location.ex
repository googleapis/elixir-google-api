defmodule GoogleApi.CivicInfo.V2.Model.PollingLocation do
  @moduledoc """
  A location where a voter can vote. This may be an early vote site, an election day voting location, or a drop off location for a completed ballot.

  ## Attributes

  *   `address` (*type:* `GoogleApi.CivicInfo.V2.Model.SimpleAddressType.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The address of the location.
  *   `endDate` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The last date that this early vote site or drop off location may be used. This field is not populated for polling locations.
  *   `id` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - An ID for this object. IDs may change in future requests and should not be cached. Access to this field requires special access that can be requested from the Request more link on the Quotas page.
  *   `latitude` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Latitude of the location, in degrees north of the equator. Only some locations -- generally, ballot drop boxes for vote-by-mail elections -- will have this set; for others, use a geocoding service like the Google Maps API to resolve the address to a geographic point.
  *   `longitude` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Longitude of the location, in degrees east of the Prime Meridian. Only some locations -- generally, ballot drop boxes for vote-by-mail elections -- will have this set; for others, use a geocoding service like the Google Maps API to resolve the address to a geographic point.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The name of the early vote site or drop off location. This field is not populated for polling locations.
  *   `notes` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Notes about this location (e.g. accessibility ramp or entrance to use).
  *   `pollingHours` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A description of when this location is open.
  *   `sources` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.CivicInfo.V2.Model.Source.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - A list of sources for this location. If multiple sources are listed the data has been aggregated from those sources.
  *   `startDate` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The first date that this early vote site or drop off location may be used. This field is not populated for polling locations.
  *   `voterServices` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The services provided by this early vote site or drop off location. This field is not populated for polling locations.
