defmodule GoogleApi.Batch.V1.Model.TaskExecution do
  @moduledoc """
  This Task Execution field includes detail information for task execution procedures, based on StatusEvent types.

  ## Attributes

  *   `exitCode` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - The exit code of a finished task. If the task succeeded, the exit code will be 0. If the task failed but not due to the following reasons, the exit code will be 50000. Otherwise, it can be from different sources: * Batch known failures: https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs/troubleshooting#reserved-exit-codes. * Batch runnable execution failures; you can rely on Batch logs to further diagnose: https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs/analyze-job-using-logs. If there are multiple runnables failures, Batch only exposes the first error.
