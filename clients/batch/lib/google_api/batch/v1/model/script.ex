  ## Attributes

  *   `path` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The path to a script file that is accessible from the host VM(s). Unless the script file supports the default `#!/bin/sh` shell interpreter, you must specify an interpreter by including a [shebang line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix) as the first line of the file. For example, to execute the script using bash, include `#!/bin/bash` as the first line of the file. Alternatively, to execute the script using Python3, include `#!/usr/bin/env python3` as the first line of the file.
  *   `text` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The text for a script. Unless the script text supports the default `#!/bin/sh` shell interpreter, you must specify an interpreter by including a [shebang line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix) at the beginning of the text. For example, to execute the script using bash, include `#!/bin/bash\\n` at the beginning of the text. Alternatively, to execute the script using Python3, include `#!/usr/bin/env python3\\n` at the beginning of the text.
