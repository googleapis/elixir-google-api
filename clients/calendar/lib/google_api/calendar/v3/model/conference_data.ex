  - createRequest (CreateConferenceRequest): A request to generate a new conference and attach it to the event. The data is generated asynchronously. To see whether the data is present check the status field. Either conferenceSolution and at least one entryPoint, or createRequest is required. Defaults to: `null`.
  - entryPoints ([EntryPoint]): Information about individual conference entry points, such as URLs or phone numbers. All of them must belong to the same conference. Either conferenceSolution and at least one entryPoint, or createRequest is required. Defaults to: `null`.
