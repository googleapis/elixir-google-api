defmodule GoogleApi.CloudTrace.V2.Model.Span do
  @moduledoc """
  A span represents a single operation within a trace. Spans can be nested to form a trace tree. Often, a trace contains a root span that describes the end-to-end latency, and one or more subspans for its sub-operations. A trace can also contain multiple root spans, or none at all. Spans do not need to be contiguous&amp;mdash;there may be gaps or overlaps between spans in a trace.
