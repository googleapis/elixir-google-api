  - status (String.t): The status of the room.
  Possible values are:  
  - "ROOM_INVITING" - One or more players have been invited and not responded. 
  - "ROOM_AUTO_MATCHING" - One or more slots need to be filled by auto-matching. 
  - "ROOM_CONNECTING" - Players have joined are connecting to each other (either before or after auto-matching).
