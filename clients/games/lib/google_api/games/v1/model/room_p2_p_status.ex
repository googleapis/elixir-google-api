defmodule GoogleApi.Games.V1.Model.RoomP2PStatus do
  @moduledoc """
  This is a JSON template for an update on the status of a peer in a room.

  ## Attributes

  - connectionSetupLatencyMillis (integer()): The amount of time in milliseconds it took to establish connections with this peer. Defaults to `nil`.
  - error (String.t): The error code in event of a failure.
  Possible values are:  
  - "P2P_FAILED" - The client failed to establish a P2P connection with the peer. 
  - "PRESENCE_FAILED" - The client failed to register to receive P2P connections. 
  - "RELAY_SERVER_FAILED" - The client received an error when trying to use the relay server to establish a P2P connection with the peer. Defaults to `nil`.
  - error_reason (String.t): More detailed diagnostic message returned in event of a failure. Defaults to `nil`.
  - kind (String.t): Uniquely identifies the type of this resource. Value is always the fixed string games#roomP2PStatus. Defaults to `games#roomP2PStatus`.
  - participantId (String.t): The ID of the participant. Defaults to `nil`.
  - status (String.t): The status of the peer in the room.
  Possible values are:  
  - "CONNECTION_ESTABLISHED" - The client established a P2P connection with the peer. 
  - "CONNECTION_FAILED" - The client failed to establish directed presence with the peer. Defaults to `nil`.
  - unreliableRoundtripLatencyMillis (integer()): The amount of time in milliseconds it took to send packets back and forth on the unreliable channel with this peer. Defaults to `nil`.
