  *   `maxHandlingTime` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Maximum handling time (inclusive) between when the order is received and shipped in business days. 0 means that the order is shipped on the same day as it's received if it happens before the cut-off time.

  *   `minTransitTime` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Minimum transit time (inclusive) between when the order has shipped and when it's delivered in business days. 0 means that the order is delivered on the same day as it ships. minTransitTime can only be present together with maxTransitTime; but it's not required if maxTransitTime is present.
