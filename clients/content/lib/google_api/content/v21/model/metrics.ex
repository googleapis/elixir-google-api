  Performance metrics. Values are only set for metrics requested explicitly in the request's search query.

  ## Attributes

  *   `aos` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Average order size - the average number of items in an order. **This metric cannot be segmented by product dimensions and customer_country_code.**
  *   `aovMicros` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Average order value - the average value (total price of items) of all placed orders. The currency of the returned value is stored in the currency_code segment. If this metric is selected, 'segments.currency_code' is automatically added to the SELECT clause in the search query (unless it is explicitly selected by the user) and the currency_code segment is populated in the response. **This metric cannot be segmented by product dimensions and customer_country_code.**
  *   `clicks` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Number of clicks.
  *   `conversionRate` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Number of conversions divided by the number of clicks, reported on the impression date. The metric is currently available only for the FREE_PRODUCT_LISTING program.
  *   `conversionValueMicros` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Value of conversions in micros attributed to the product, reported on the conversion date. The metric is currently available only for the FREE_PRODUCT_LISTING program. The currency of the returned value is stored in the currency_code segment. If this metric is selected, 'segments.currency_code' is automatically added to the SELECT clause in the search query (unless it is explicitly selected by the user) and the currency_code segment is populated in the response.
  *   `conversions` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Number of conversions attributed to the product, reported on the conversion date. Depending on the attribution model, a conversion might be distributed across multiple clicks, where each click gets its own credit assigned. This metric is a sum of all such credits. The metric is currently available only for the FREE_PRODUCT_LISTING program.
  *   `ctr` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Click-through rate - the number of clicks merchant's products receive (clicks) divided by the number of times the products are shown (impressions).
  *   `daysToShip` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Average number of days between an order being placed and the order being fully shipped, reported on the last shipment date. **This metric cannot be segmented by product dimensions and customer_country_code.**
  *   `impressions` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Number of times merchant's products are shown.
  *   `itemDaysToShip` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Average number of days between an item being ordered and the item being **This metric cannot be segmented by customer_country_code.**
  *   `itemFillRate` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Percentage of shipped items in relation to all finalized items (shipped or rejected by the merchant; unshipped items are not taken into account), reported on the order date. Item fill rate is lowered by merchant rejections. **This metric cannot be segmented by customer_country_code.**
  *   `orderedItemSalesMicros` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Total price of ordered items. Excludes shipping, taxes (US only), and customer cancellations that happened within 30 minutes of placing the order. The currency of the returned value is stored in the currency_code segment. If this metric is selected, 'segments.currency_code' is automatically added to the SELECT clause in the search query (unless it is explicitly selected by the user) and the currency_code segment is populated in the response. **This metric cannot be segmented by customer_country_code.**
  *   `orderedItems` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Number of ordered items. Excludes customer cancellations that happened within 30 minutes of placing the order. **This metric cannot be segmented by customer_country_code.**
  *   `orders` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Number of placed orders. Excludes customer cancellations that happened within 30 minutes of placing the order. **This metric cannot be segmented by product dimensions and customer_country_code.**
  *   `rejectedItems` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Number of ordered items canceled by the merchant, reported on the order date. **This metric cannot be segmented by customer_country_code.**
  *   `returnRate` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Total price of returned items divided by the total price of shipped items, reported on the order date. If this metric is selected, 'segments.currency_code' is automatically added to the SELECT clause in the search query (unless it is explicitly selected by the user) and the currency_code segment is populated in the response. **This metric cannot be segmented by customer_country_code.**
  *   `returnedItems` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Number of ordered items sent back for return, reported on the date when the merchant accepted the return. **This metric cannot be segmented by customer_country_code.**
  *   `returnsMicros` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Total price of ordered items sent back for return, reported on the date when the merchant accepted the return. The currency of the returned value is stored in the currency_code segment. If this metric is selected, 'segments.currency_code' is automatically added to the SELECT clause in the search query (unless it is explicitly selected by the user) and the currency_code segment is populated in the response. **This metric cannot be segmented by customer_country_code.**
  *   `shippedItemSalesMicros` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Total price of shipped items, reported on the order date. Excludes shipping and taxes (US only). The currency of the returned value is stored in the currency_code segment. If this metric is selected, 'segments.currency_code' is automatically added to the SELECT clause in the search query (unless it is explicitly selected by the user) and the currency_code segment is populated in the response. **This metric cannot be segmented by customer_country_code.**
  *   `shippedItems` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Number of shipped items, reported on the shipment date. **This metric cannot be segmented by customer_country_code.**
  *   `shippedOrders` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Number of fully shipped orders, reported on the last shipment date. **This metric cannot be segmented by product dimensions and customer_country_code.**
  *   `unshippedItems` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Number of ordered items not shipped up until the end of the queried day. If a multi-day period is specified in the search query, the returned value is the average number of unshipped items over the days in the queried period. **This metric cannot be segmented by customer_country_code.**
  *   `unshippedOrders` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Number of orders not shipped or partially shipped up until the end of the queried day. If a multi-day period is specified in the search query, the returned value is the average number of unshipped orders over the days in the queried period. **This metric cannot be segmented by product dimensions and customer_country_code.**
