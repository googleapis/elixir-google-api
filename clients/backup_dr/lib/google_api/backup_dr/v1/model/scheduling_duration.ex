  A SchedulingDuration represents a fixed-length span of time represented as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond resolution. It is independent of any calendar and concepts like "day" or "month". Range is approximately 10,000 years.

  ## Attributes

  *   `nanos` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. Span of time that's a fraction of a second at nanosecond resolution.
  *   `seconds` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. Span of time at a resolution of a second.
