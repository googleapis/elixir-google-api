defmodule GoogleApi.Spanner.V1.Model.ListBackupOperationsResponse do
  @moduledoc """
  The response for
  ListBackupOperations.

  ## Attributes

  *   `nextPageToken` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - `next_page_token` can be sent in a subsequent
      ListBackupOperations
      call to fetch more of the matching metadata.
  *   `operations` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.Spanner.V1.Model.Operation.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The list of matching backup long-running
      operations. Each operation's name will be
      prefixed by the backup's name and the operation's
      metadata will be of type
      CreateBackupMetadata. Operations returned include those that are
      pending or have completed/failed/canceled within the last 7 days.
      Operations returned are ordered by
      `operation.metadata.value.progress.start_time` in descending order starting
      from the most recently started operation.
