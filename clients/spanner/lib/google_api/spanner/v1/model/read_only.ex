defmodule GoogleApi.Spanner.V1.Model.ReadOnly do
  @moduledoc """
  Message type to initiate a read-only transaction.

  ## Attributes

  *   `exactStaleness` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Executes all reads at a timestamp that is `exact_staleness`
      old. The timestamp is chosen soon after the read is started.

      Guarantees that all writes that have committed more than the
      specified number of seconds ago are visible. Because Cloud Spanner
      chooses the exact timestamp, this mode works even if the client's
      local clock is substantially skewed from Cloud Spanner commit
      timestamps.

      Useful for reading at nearby replicas without the distributed
      timestamp negotiation overhead of `max_staleness`.
  *   `maxStaleness` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Read data at a timestamp >= `NOW - max_staleness`
      seconds. Guarantees that all writes that have committed more
      than the specified number of seconds ago are visible. Because
      Cloud Spanner chooses the exact timestamp, this mode works even if
      the client's local clock is substantially skewed from Cloud Spanner
      commit timestamps.

      Useful for reading the freshest data available at a nearby
      replica, while bounding the possible staleness if the local
      replica has fallen behind.

      Note that this option can only be used in single-use
      transactions.
  *   `minReadTimestamp` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Executes all reads at a timestamp >= `min_read_timestamp`.

      This is useful for requesting fresher data than some previous
      read, or data that is fresh enough to observe the effects of some
      previously committed transaction whose timestamp is known.

      Note that this option can only be used in single-use transactions.

      A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC \"Zulu\" format, accurate to nanoseconds.
      Example: `"2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z"`.
  *   `readTimestamp` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Executes all reads at the given timestamp. Unlike other modes,
      reads at a specific timestamp are repeatable; the same read at
      the same timestamp always returns the same data. If the
      timestamp is in the future, the read will block until the
      specified timestamp, modulo the read's deadline.

      Useful for large scale consistent reads such as mapreduces, or
      for coordinating many reads against a consistent snapshot of the
      data.

      A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC \"Zulu\" format, accurate to nanoseconds.
      Example: `"2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z"`.
  *   `returnReadTimestamp` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - If true, the Cloud Spanner-selected read timestamp is included in
      the Transaction message that describes the transaction.
  *   `strong` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Read at a timestamp where all previously committed transactions
      are visible.
