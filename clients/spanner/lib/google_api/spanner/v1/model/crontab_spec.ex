defmodule GoogleApi.Spanner.V1.Model.CrontabSpec do
  @moduledoc """
  CrontabSpec can be used to specify the version time and frequency at which the backup is created.

  ## Attributes

  *   `creationWindow` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. Scheduled backups contain an externally consistent copy of the database at the version time specified in `schedule_spec.cron_spec`. However, Spanner might not initiate the creation of the scheduled backups at that version time. Spanner initiates the creation of scheduled backups within the time window bounded by the version_time specified in `schedule_spec.cron_spec` and version_time + `creation_window`.
  *   `text` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. Textual representation of the crontab. User can customize the backup frequency and the backup version time using the cron expression. The version time must be in UTC timezone. The backup will contain an externally consistent copy of the database at the version time. Full backups must be scheduled a minimum of 12 hours apart and incremental backups must be scheduled a minimum of 4 hours apart. Examples of valid cron specifications: * `0 2/12 * * *` : every 12 hours at (2, 14) hours past midnight in UTC. * `0 2,14 * * *` : every 12 hours at (2, 14) hours past midnight in UTC. * `0 */4 * * *` : (incremental backups only) every 4 hours at (0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20) hours past midnight in UTC. * `0 2 * * *` : once a day at 2 past midnight in UTC. * `0 2 * * 0` : once a week every Sunday at 2 past midnight in UTC. * `0 2 8 * *` : once a month on 8th day at 2 past midnight in UTC.
  *   `timeZone` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The time zone of the times in `CrontabSpec.text`. Currently, only UTC is supported.
