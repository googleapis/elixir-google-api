defmodule GoogleApi.Spanner.V1.Model.CrontabSpec do
  @moduledoc """
  CrontabSpec can be used to specify the version time and frequency at which the backup should be created.

  ## Attributes

  *   `creationWindow` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. Schedule backups will contain an externally consistent copy of the database at the version time specified in `schedule_spec.cron_spec`. However, Spanner may not initiate the creation of the scheduled backups at that version time. Spanner will initiate the creation of scheduled backups within the time window bounded by the version_time specified in `schedule_spec.cron_spec` and version_time + `creation_window`.
  *   `text` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. Textual representation of the crontab. User can customize the backup frequency and the backup version time using the cron expression. The version time must be in UTC timzeone. The backup will contain an externally consistent copy of the database at the version time. Allowed frequencies are 12 hour, 1 day, 1 week and 1 month. Examples of valid cron specifications: * `0 2/12 * * * ` : every 12 hours at (2, 14) hours past midnight in UTC. * `0 2,14 * * * ` : every 12 hours at (2,14) hours past midnight in UTC. * `0 2 * * * ` : once a day at 2 past midnight in UTC. * `0 2 * * 0 ` : once a week every Sunday at 2 past midnight in UTC. * `0 2 8 * * ` : once a month on 8th day at 2 past midnight in UTC.
  *   `timeZone` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The time zone of the times in `CrontabSpec.text`. Currently only UTC is supported.
