defmodule GoogleApi.Spanner.V1.Model.ExecuteBatchDmlRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  The request for ExecuteBatchDml.

  ## Attributes

  *   `seqno` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A per-transaction sequence number used to identify this request. This field
      makes each request idempotent such that if the request is received multiple
      times, at most one will succeed.

      The sequence number must be monotonically increasing within the
      transaction. If a request arrives for the first time with an out-of-order
      sequence number, the transaction may be aborted. Replays of previously
      handled requests will yield the same response as the first execution.
  *   `statements` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.Spanner.V1.Model.Statement.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The list of statements to execute in this batch. Statements are executed
      serially, such that the effects of statement `i` are visible to statement
      `i+1`. Each statement must be a DML statement. Execution stops at the
      first failed statement; the remaining statements are not executed.

      Callers must provide at least one statement.
  *   `transaction` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Spanner.V1.Model.TransactionSelector.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The transaction to use. Must be a read-write transaction.

      To protect against replays, single-use transactions are not supported. The
      caller must either supply an existing transaction ID or begin a new
      transaction.
