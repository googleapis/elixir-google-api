  @moduledoc """
  Common request options for various APIs.

  ## Attributes

  *   `priority` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Priority for the request.
  *   `requestTag` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A per-request tag which can be applied to queries or reads, used for statistics collection. Both `request_tag` and `transaction_tag` can be specified for a read or query that belongs to a transaction. This field is ignored for requests where it's not applicable (for example, `CommitRequest`). Legal characters for `request_tag` values are all printable characters (ASCII 32 - 126) and the length of a request_tag is limited to 50 characters. Values that exceed this limit are truncated. Any leading underscore (_) characters are removed from the string.
  *   `transactionTag` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A tag used for statistics collection about this transaction. Both `request_tag` and `transaction_tag` can be specified for a read or query that belongs to a transaction. The value of transaction_tag should be the same for all requests belonging to the same transaction. If this request doesn't belong to any transaction, `transaction_tag` is ignored. Legal characters for `transaction_tag` values are all printable characters (ASCII 32 - 126) and the length of a `transaction_tag` is limited to 50 characters. Values that exceed this limit are truncated. Any leading underscore (_) characters are removed from the string.
