defmodule GoogleApi.Spanner.V1.Model.ExecuteBatchDmlResponse do
  @moduledoc """
  The response for ExecuteBatchDml. Contains a list
  of ResultSet messages, one for each DML statement that has successfully
  executed, in the same order as the statements in the request. If a statement
  fails, the status in the response body identifies the cause of the failure.

  To check for DML statements that failed, use the following approach:

  1. Check the status in the response message. The google.rpc.Code enum
     value `OK` indicates that all statements were executed successfully.
  2. If the status was not `OK`, check the number of result sets in the
     response. If the response contains `N` ResultSet messages, then
     statement `N+1` in the request failed.

  Example 1:

  * Request: 5 DML statements, all executed successfully.
  * Response: 5 ResultSet messages, with the status `OK`.

  Example 2:

  * Request: 5 DML statements. The third statement has a syntax error.
  * Response: 2 ResultSet messages, and a syntax error (`INVALID_ARGUMENT`)
    status. The number of ResultSet messages indicates that the third
    statement failed, and the fourth and fifth statements were not executed.

  ## Attributes

  *   `resultSets` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.Spanner.V1.Model.ResultSet.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - One ResultSet for each statement in the request that ran successfully,
      in the same order as the statements in the request. Each ResultSet does
      not contain any rows. The ResultSetStats in each ResultSet contain
      the number of rows modified by the statement.

      Only the first ResultSet in the response contains valid
      ResultSetMetadata.
  *   `status` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Spanner.V1.Model.Status.t`, *default:* `nil`) - If all DML statements are executed successfully, the status is `OK`.
      Otherwise, the error status of the first failed statement.
