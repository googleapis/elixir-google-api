defmodule GoogleApi.Spanner.V1.Model.Backup do
  @moduledoc """
  A backup of a Cloud Spanner database.

  ## Attributes

  *   `createTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The backup will contain an externally consistent
      copy of the database at the timestamp specified by
      `create_time`. `create_time` is approximately the time the
      CreateBackup request is received.
  *   `database` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required for the CreateBackup operation.
      Name of the database from which this backup was
      created. This needs to be in the same instance as the backup.
      Values are of the form
      `projects/<project>/instances/<instance>/databases/<database>`.
  *   `expireTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required for the CreateBackup
      operation. The expiration time of the backup, with microseconds
      granularity that must be at least 6 hours and at most 366 days
      from the time the CreateBackup request is processed. Once the `expire_time`
      has passed, the backup is eligible to be automatically deleted by Cloud
      Spanner to free the resources used by the backup.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only for the CreateBackup][DatabaseAdmin.CreateBackup] operation.
      Required for the UpdateBackup operation.

      A globally unique identifier for the backup which cannot be
      changed. Values are of the form
      `projects/<project>/instances/<instance>/backups/a-z*[a-z0-9]`
      The final segment of the name must be between 2 and 60 characters
      in length.

      The backup is stored in the location(s) specified in the instance
      configuration of the instance containing the backup, identified
      by the prefix of the backup name of the form
      `projects/<project>/instances/<instance>`.
  *   `referencingDatabases` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The names of the restored databases that reference the backup.
      The database names are of
      the form `projects/<project>/instances/<instance>/databases/<database>`.
      Referencing databases may exist in different instances. The existence of
      any referencing database prevents the backup from being deleted. When a
      restored database from the backup enters the `READY` state, the reference
      to the backup is removed.
  *   `sizeBytes` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. Size of the backup in bytes.
  *   `state` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The current state of the backup.
