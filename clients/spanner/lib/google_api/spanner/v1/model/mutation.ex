defmodule GoogleApi.Spanner.V1.Model.Mutation do
  @moduledoc """
  A modification to one or more Cloud Spanner rows.  Mutations can be applied to a Cloud Spanner database by sending them in a Commit call.

  ## Attributes

  - delete (Delete): Delete rows from a table. Succeeds whether or not the named rows were present. Defaults to: `null`.
  - insert (Write): Insert new rows in a table. If any of the rows already exist, the write or transaction fails with error &#x60;ALREADY_EXISTS&#x60;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - insertOrUpdate (Write): Like insert, except that if the row already exists, then its column values are overwritten with the ones provided. Any column values not explicitly written are preserved. Defaults to: `null`.
  - replace (Write): Like insert, except that if the row already exists, it is deleted, and the column values provided are inserted instead. Unlike insert_or_update, this means any values not explicitly written become &#x60;NULL&#x60;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - update (Write): Update existing rows in a table. If any of the rows does not already exist, the transaction fails with error &#x60;NOT_FOUND&#x60;. Defaults to: `null`.
