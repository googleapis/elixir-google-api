  @moduledoc """
  A boundary on the scope of impact that the metadata import job can have.

  ## Attributes

  *   `aspectTypes` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. The aspect types that are in scope for the import job, specified as relative resource names in the format projects/{project_number_or_id}/locations/{location_id}/aspectTypes/{aspect_type_id}. The job modifies only the aspects that belong to these aspect types.If the metadata import file attempts to modify an aspect whose type isn't included in this list, the import job is halted before modifying any entries or aspects.The location of an aspect type must either match the location of the job, or the aspect type must be global.
  *   `entryGroups` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The entry group that is in scope for the import job, specified as a relative resource name in the format projects/{project_number_or_id}/locations/{location_id}/entryGroups/{entry_group_id}. Only entries that belong to the specified entry group are affected by the job.Must contain exactly one element. The entry group and the job must be in the same location.
  *   `entryTypes` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The entry types that are in scope for the import job, specified as relative resource names in the format projects/{project_number_or_id}/locations/{location_id}/entryTypes/{entry_type_id}. The job modifies only the entries that belong to these entry types.If the metadata import file attempts to modify an entry whose type isn't included in this list, the import job is halted before modifying any entries or aspects.The location of an entry type must either match the location of the job, or the entry type must be global.
