  @moduledoc """
  Input only.  Deprecated. Use JobQuery instead.  The filters required to perform a search query or histogram.

  ## Attributes

  - categories ([String.t]): Optional.  The category filter specifies the categories of jobs to search against. See Category for more information.  If a value is not specified, jobs from any category are searched against.  If multiple values are specified, jobs from any of the specified categories are searched against. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of 
  - commuteFilter (CommutePreference): Optional.   Allows filtering jobs by commute time with different travel methods (e.g.  driving or public transit). Note: this only works with COMMUTE  MODE. When specified, [JobFilters.location_filters] will be  ignored.   Currently we do not support sorting by commute time. Defaults to: `null`.
  - companyNames ([String.t]): Optional.  The company names filter specifies the company entities to search against.  If a value is not specified, jobs are searched for against all companies.  If multiple values are specified, jobs are searched against the specified companies.  At most 20 company filters are allowed. Defaults to: `null`.
  - companyTitles ([String.t]): Optional.  This filter specifies the exact company titles of jobs to search against.  If a value is not specified, jobs within the search results can be associated with any company.  If multiple values are specified, jobs within the search results may be associated with any of the specified companies.  At most 20 company title filters are allowed. Defaults to: `null`.
  - compensationFilter (CompensationFilter): Optional.  This search filter is applied only to Job.compensation_info. For example, if the filter is specified as \&quot;Hourly job with per-hour compensation &gt; $15\&quot;, only jobs that meet this criteria are searched. If a filter is not defined, all open jobs are searched. Defaults to: `null`.
  - customAttributeFilter (String.t): Optional.  This filter specifies a structured syntax to match against the Job.custom_attributes that are marked as &#x60;filterable&#x60;.  The syntax for this expression is a subset of Google SQL syntax.  Supported operators are: &#x3D;, !&#x3D;, &lt;, &lt;&#x3D;, &gt;, &gt;&#x3D; where the left of the operator is a custom field key and the right of the operator is a number or string (surrounded by quotes) value.  Supported functions are LOWER(&lt;field_name&gt;) to perform case insensitive match and EMPTY(&lt;field_name&gt;) to filter on the existence of a key.  Boolean expressions (AND/OR/NOT) are supported up to 3 levels of nesting (For example, \&quot;((A AND B AND C) OR NOT D) AND E\&quot;), and there can be a maximum of 100 comparisons/functions in the expression. The expression must be &lt; 3000 bytes in length.  Sample Query: (key1 &#x3D; \&quot;TEST\&quot; OR LOWER(key1)&#x3D;\&quot;test\&quot; OR NOT EMPTY(key1)) AND key2 &gt; 100 Defaults to: `null`.
  - customFieldFilters (%{optional(String.t) &#x3D;&gt; CustomFieldFilter}): Deprecated. Use custom_attribute_filter instead.  Optional.  This filter specifies searching against custom field values. See Job.filterable_custom_fields for information. The key value specifies a number between 1-20 (the service supports 20 custom fields) corresponding to the desired custom field map value. If an invalid key is provided or specified together with custom_attribute_filter, an error is thrown. Defaults to: `null`.
  - disableSpellCheck (boolean()): Optional.  This flag controls the spell-check feature. If false, the service attempts to correct a misspelled query, for example, \&quot;enginee\&quot; is corrected to \&quot;engineer\&quot;.  Defaults to false: a spell check is performed. Defaults to: `null`.
  - employmentTypes ([String.t]): Optional.  The employment type filter specifies the employment type of jobs to search against, such as EmploymentType.FULL_TIME.  If a value is not specified, jobs in the search results include any employment type.  If multiple values are specified, jobs in the search results include any of the specified employment types. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of 
  - extendedCompensationFilter (ExtendedCompensationFilter): Deprecated. Always use compensation_filter.  Optional.  This search filter is applied only to Job.extended_compensation_info. For example, if the filter is specified as \&quot;Hourly job with per-hour compensation &gt; $15\&quot;, only jobs that meet these criteria are searched. If a filter is not defined, all open jobs are searched. Defaults to: `null`.
  - languageCodes ([String.t]): Optional.  This filter specifies the locale of jobs to search against, for example, \&quot;en-US\&quot;.  If a value is not specified, the search results may contain jobs in any locale.   Language codes should be in BCP-47 format, for example, \&quot;en-US\&quot; or \&quot;sr-Latn\&quot;. For more information, see [Tags for Identifying Languages](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47).  At most 10 language code filters are allowed. Defaults to: `null`.
  - locationFilters ([LocationFilter]): Optional.  The location filter specifies geo-regions containing the jobs to search against. See LocationFilter for more information.  If a location value is not specified, jobs are be retrieved from all locations.  If multiple values are specified, jobs are retrieved from any of the specified locations, and, if different values are specified for the LocationFilter.distance_in_miles parameter, the maximum provided distance is used for all locations.  At most 5 location filters are allowed. Defaults to: `null`.
  - publishDateRange (String.t): Optional.  Jobs published within a range specified by this filter are searched against, for example, DateRange.PAST_MONTH. If a value is not specified, all open jobs are searched against regardless of the date they were published. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [DATE_RANGE_UNSPECIFIED, PAST_24_HOURS, PAST_WEEK, PAST_MONTH, PAST_YEAR, PAST_3_DAYS]
  - query (String.t): Optional.  The query filter contains the keywords that match against the job title, description, and location fields.  The maximum query size is 255 bytes/characters. Defaults to: `null`.
  - tenantJobOnly (boolean()): Deprecated. Do not use this field.  This flag controls whether the job search should be restricted to jobs owned by the current user.  Defaults to false where all jobs accessible to the user are searched against. Defaults to: `null`.
