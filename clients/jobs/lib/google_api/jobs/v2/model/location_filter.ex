defmodule GoogleApi.Jobs.V2.Model.LocationFilter do
  @moduledoc """
  Input only.

  Geographic region of the search.

  ## Attributes

  *   `distanceInMiles` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional.


      The distance_in_miles is applied when the location being searched for is
      identified as a city or smaller. When the location being searched for is a
      state or larger, this field is ignored.
  *   `isTelecommute` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional.

      Allows the client to return jobs without a
      set location, specifically, telecommuting jobs (telecomuting is considered
      by the service as a special location.
      Job.allow_telecommute indicates if a job permits telecommuting.
      If this field is true, telecommuting jobs are searched, and
      name and lat_lng are
      ignored.
      This filter can be used by itself to search exclusively for telecommuting
      jobs, or it can be combined with another location
      filter to search for a combination of job locations,
      such as "Mountain View" or "telecommuting" jobs. However, when used in
      combination with other location filters, telecommuting jobs can be
      treated as less relevant than other jobs in the search response.
  *   `latLng` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Jobs.V2.Model.LatLng.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional.

      The latitude and longitude of the geographic center from which to
      search. This field is ignored if `location_name` is provided.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional.

      The address name, such as "Mountain View" or "Bay Area".
  *   `regionCode` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional.

      CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This will be used
      to address ambiguity of the user-input location, e.g. "Liverpool"
      against "Liverpool, NY, US" or "Liverpool, UK".

      Set this field if all the jobs to search against are from a same region,
      or jobs are world-wide but the job seeker is from a specific region.

      See http://cldr.unicode.org/ and
      http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html
      for details. Example: "CH" for Switzerland.
