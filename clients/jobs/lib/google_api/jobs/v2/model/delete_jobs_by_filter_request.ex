defmodule GoogleApi.Jobs.V2.Model.DeleteJobsByFilterRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  Deprecated. Use BatchDeleteJobsRequest instead.  Input only.  Delete job by filter request.  The job typically becomes unsearchable within 10 seconds, but it may take up to 5 minutes.

  ## Attributes

  - disableFastProcess (boolean()): Optional.  If set to true, this call waits for all processing steps to complete before the job is cleaned up. Otherwise, the call returns while some steps are still taking place asynchronously, hence faster. Defaults to: `null`.
  - filter (Filter): Required.  Restrictions on the scope of the delete request. Defaults to: `null`.
