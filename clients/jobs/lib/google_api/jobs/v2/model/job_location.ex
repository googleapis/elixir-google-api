defmodule GoogleApi.Jobs.V2.Model.JobLocation do
  @moduledoc """
  Output only.

  A resource that represents a location with full geographic
  information.

  ## Attributes

  - latLng (GoogleApi.Jobs.V2.Model.LatLng.t): An object representing a latitude/longitude pair. Defaults to `nil`.
  - locationType (String.t): The type of a location, which corresponds to the address lines field of
  PostalAddress. For example, "Downtown, Atlanta, GA, USA" has a type of
  LocationType#NEIGHBORHOOD, and "Kansas City, KS, USA" has a type of
  LocationType#LOCALITY. Defaults to `nil`.
  - postalAddress (GoogleApi.Jobs.V2.Model.PostalAddress.t): Postal address of the location that includes human readable information,
  such as postal delivery and payments addresses. Given a postal address,
  a postal service can deliver items to a premises, P.O. Box, or other
  delivery location. Defaults to `nil`.
  - radiusMeters (float()): Radius in meters of the job location. This value is derived from the
  location bounding box in which a circle with the specified radius
  centered from LatLng coves the area associated with the job location.
  For example, currently, "Mountain View, CA, USA" has a radius of
  7885.79 meters. Defaults to `nil`.
