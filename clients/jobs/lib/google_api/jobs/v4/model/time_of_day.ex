defmodule GoogleApi.Jobs.V4.Model.TimeOfDay do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents a time of day. The date and time zone are either not significant or are specified elsewhere. An API may choose to allow leap seconds. Related types are google.type.Date and `google.protobuf.Timestamp`.

  ## Attributes

  *   `hours` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Hours of a day in 24 hour format. Must be greater than or equal to 0 and typically must be less than or equal to 23. An API may choose to allow the value "24:00:00" for scenarios like business closing time.
  *   `minutes` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Minutes of an hour. Must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 59.
  *   `nanos` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Fractions of seconds, in nanoseconds. Must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 999,999,999.
  *   `seconds` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Seconds of a minute. Must be greater than or equal to 0 and typically must be less than or equal to 59. An API may allow the value 60 if it allows leap-seconds.
