defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceConsumerManagement.V1.Model.Usage do
  @moduledoc """
  Configuration controlling usage of a service.

  ## Attributes

  - producerNotificationChannel (String.t): The full resource name of a channel used for sending notifications to the
  service producer.

  Google Service Management currently only supports
  [Google Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub) as a notification
  channel. To use Google Cloud Pub/Sub as the channel, this must be the name
  of a Cloud Pub/Sub topic that uses the Cloud Pub/Sub topic name format
  documented in https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview. Defaults to `nil`.
  - requirements (list(String.t)): Requirements that must be satisfied before a consumer project can use the
  service. Each requirement is of the form <service.name>/<requirement-id>;
  for example 'serviceusage.googleapis.com/billing-enabled'. Defaults to `nil`.
  - rules (list(GoogleApi.ServiceConsumerManagement.V1.Model.UsageRule.t)): A list of usage rules that apply to individual API methods.

  **NOTE:** All service configuration rules follow "last one wins" order. Defaults to `nil`.
