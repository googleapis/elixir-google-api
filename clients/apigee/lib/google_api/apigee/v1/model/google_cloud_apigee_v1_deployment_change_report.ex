defmodule GoogleApi.Apigee.V1.Model.GoogleCloudApigeeV1DeploymentChangeReport do
  @moduledoc """
  Response for
  GenerateDeployChangeReport
  and
  GenerateUndeployChangeReport.

  This report contains any validation failures that would cause the deployment
  to be rejected, as well changes and conflicts in routing that may occur due
  to the new deployment.

  The existence of a routing warning does not necessarily imply that the
  deployment request is bad, if the desired state of the deployment request is
  to effect a routing change. The primary purposes of the routing messages are:

  1) To inform users of routing changes that may have an effect on traffic
  currently being routed to other existing deployments.

  2) To warn users if some basepath in the proxy will not receive traffic due
  to an existing deployment having already claimed that basepath.

  The presence of routing conflicts/changes will not cause non-dry-run
  DeployApiProxy/UndeployApiProxy requests to be rejected.

  ## Attributes

  *   `routingChanges` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.Apigee.V1.Model.GoogleCloudApigeeV1DeploymentChangeReportRoutingChange.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - All routing changes that may result from a deployment request.
  *   `routingConflicts` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.Apigee.V1.Model.GoogleCloudApigeeV1DeploymentChangeReportRoutingConflict.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - All basepath conflicts detected for a deployment request.
  *   `validationErrors` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Apigee.V1.Model.GoogleRpcPreconditionFailure.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Validation errors that would cause the deployment change request to be
      rejected.
