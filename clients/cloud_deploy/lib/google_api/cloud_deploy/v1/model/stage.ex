defmodule GoogleApi.CloudDeploy.V1.Model.Stage do
  @moduledoc """
  Stage specifies a location to which to deploy.

  ## Attributes

  *   `profiles` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Skaffold profiles to use when rendering the manifest for this stage's `Target`.
  *   `targetId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The target_id to which this stage points. This field refers exclusively to the last segment of a target name. For example, this field would just be `my-target` (rather than `projects/project/locations/location/targets/my-target`). The location of the `Target` is inferred to be the same as the location of the `DeliveryPipeline` that contains this `Stage`.
