  Alternative hypotheses (a.k.a. n-best list).

  ## Attributes
  
  *   `confidence` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - The confidence estimate between 0.0 and 1.0. A higher number indicates an estimated greater likelihood that the recognized words are correct. This field is set only for the top alternative of a non-streaming result or, of a streaming result where is_final is set to `true`. This field is not guaranteed to be accurate and users should not rely on it to be always provided. The default of 0.0 is a sentinel value indicating `confidence` was not set.
  *   `transcript` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Transcript text representing the words that the user spoke.
  *   `words` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.Speech.V2.Model.WordInfo.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - A list of word-specific information for each recognized word. When the SpeakerDiarizationConfig is set, you will see all the words from the beginning of the audio.
