defmodule GoogleApi.Speech.V2.Model.WordInfo do
  @moduledoc """
  Word-specific information for recognized words.

  ## Attributes

  *   `confidence` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - The confidence estimate between 0.0 and 1.0. A higher number indicates an estimated greater likelihood that the recognized words are correct. This field is set only for the top alternative of a non-streaming result or, of a streaming result where is_final is set to `true`. This field is not guaranteed to be accurate and users should not rely on it to be always provided. The default of 0.0 is a sentinel value indicating `confidence` was not set.
  *   `endOffset` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Time offset relative to the beginning of the audio, and corresponding to the end of the spoken word. This field is only set if enable_word_time_offsets is `true` and only in the top hypothesis. This is an experimental feature and the accuracy of the time offset can vary.
  *   `speakerLabel` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A distinct label is assigned for every speaker within the audio. This field specifies which one of those speakers was detected to have spoken this word. `speaker_label` is set if SpeakerDiarizationConfig is given and only in the top alternative.
  *   `startOffset` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Time offset relative to the beginning of the audio, and corresponding to the start of the spoken word. This field is only set if enable_word_time_offsets is `true` and only in the top hypothesis. This is an experimental feature and the accuracy of the time offset can vary.
  *   `word` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The word corresponding to this set of information.
