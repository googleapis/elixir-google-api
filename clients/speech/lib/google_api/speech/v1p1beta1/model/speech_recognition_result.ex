defmodule GoogleApi.Speech.V1p1beta1.Model.SpeechRecognitionResult do
  @moduledoc """
  A speech recognition result corresponding to a portion of the audio.

  ## Attributes

  *   `alternatives` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.Speech.V1p1beta1.Model.SpeechRecognitionAlternative.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - May contain one or more recognition hypotheses (up to the maximum specified in `max_alternatives`). These alternatives are ordered in terms of accuracy, with the top (first) alternative being the most probable, as ranked by the recognizer.
  *   `channelTag` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - For multi-channel audio, this is the channel number corresponding to the recognized result for the audio from that channel. For audio_channel_count = N, its output values can range from '1' to 'N'.
  *   `languageCode` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The [BCP-47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) language tag of the language in this result. This language code was detected to have the most likelihood of being spoken in the audio.
  *   `resultEndTime` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Time offset of the end of this result relative to the beginning of the audio.
