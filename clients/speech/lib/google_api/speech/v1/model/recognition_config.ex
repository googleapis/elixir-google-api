defmodule GoogleApi.Speech.V1.Model.RecognitionConfig do
  @moduledoc """
  Provides information to the recognizer that specifies how to process the
  request.

  ## Attributes

  - audioChannelCount (integer()): *Optional* The number of channels in the input audio data.
  ONLY set this for MULTI-CHANNEL recognition.
  Valid values for LINEAR16 and FLAC are `1`-`8`.
  Valid values for OGG_OPUS are '1'-'254'.
  Valid value for MULAW, AMR, AMR_WB and SPEEX_WITH_HEADER_BYTE is only `1`.
  If `0` or omitted, defaults to one channel (mono).
  Note: We only recognize the first channel by default.
  To perform independent recognition on each channel set
  `enable_separate_recognition_per_channel` to 'true'. Defaults to `nil`.
  - enableAutomaticPunctuation (boolean()): *Optional* If 'true', adds punctuation to recognition result hypotheses.
  This feature is only available in select languages. Setting this for
  requests in other languages has no effect at all.
  The default 'false' value does not add punctuation to result hypotheses.
  Note: This is currently offered as an experimental service, complimentary
  to all users. In the future this may be exclusively available as a
  premium feature. Defaults to `nil`.
  - enableSeparateRecognitionPerChannel (boolean()): This needs to be set to `true` explicitly and `audio_channel_count` > 1
  to get each channel recognized separately. The recognition result will
  contain a `channel_tag` field to state which channel that result belongs
  to. If this is not true, we will only recognize the first channel. The
  request is billed cumulatively for all channels recognized:
  `audio_channel_count` multiplied by the length of the audio. Defaults to `nil`.
  - enableWordTimeOffsets (boolean()): *Optional* If `true`, the top result includes a list of words and
  the start and end time offsets (timestamps) for those words. If
  `false`, no word-level time offset information is returned. The default is
  `false`. Defaults to `nil`.
  - encoding (String.t): Encoding of audio data sent in all `RecognitionAudio` messages.
  This field is optional for `FLAC` and `WAV` audio files and required
  for all other audio formats. For details, see AudioEncoding. Defaults to `nil`.
  - languageCode (String.t): *Required* The language of the supplied audio as a
  [BCP-47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) language tag.
  Example: "en-US".
  See [Language Support](/speech-to-text/docs/languages)
  for a list of the currently supported language codes. Defaults to `nil`.
  - maxAlternatives (integer()): *Optional* Maximum number of recognition hypotheses to be returned.
  Specifically, the maximum number of `SpeechRecognitionAlternative` messages
  within each `SpeechRecognitionResult`.
  The server may return fewer than `max_alternatives`.
  Valid values are `0`-`30`. A value of `0` or `1` will return a maximum of
  one. If omitted, will return a maximum of one. Defaults to `nil`.
  - metadata (GoogleApi.Speech.V1.Model.RecognitionMetadata.t): *Optional* Metadata regarding this request. Defaults to `nil`.
  - model (String.t): *Optional* Which model to select for the given request. Select the model
  best suited to your domain to get best results. If a model is not
  explicitly specified, then we auto-select a model based on the parameters
  in the RecognitionConfig.
  <table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Model</b></td>
    <td><b>Description</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>command_and_search</code></td>
    <td>Best for short queries such as voice commands or voice search.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>phone_call</code></td>
    <td>Best for audio that originated from a phone call (typically
    recorded at an 8khz sampling rate).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>video</code></td>
    <td>Best for audio that originated from from video or includes multiple
        speakers. Ideally the audio is recorded at a 16khz or greater
        sampling rate. This is a premium model that costs more than the
        standard rate.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>default</code></td>
    <td>Best for audio that is not one of the specific audio models.
        For example, long-form audio. Ideally the audio is high-fidelity,
        recorded at a 16khz or greater sampling rate.</td>
  </tr>
  </table> Defaults to `nil`.
  - profanityFilter (boolean()): *Optional* If set to `true`, the server will attempt to filter out
  profanities, replacing all but the initial character in each filtered word
  with asterisks, e.g. "f***". If set to `false` or omitted, profanities
  won't be filtered out. Defaults to `nil`.
  - sampleRateHertz (integer()): Sample rate in Hertz of the audio data sent in all
  `RecognitionAudio` messages. Valid values are: 8000-48000.
  16000 is optimal. For best results, set the sampling rate of the audio
  source to 16000 Hz. If that's not possible, use the native sample rate of
  the audio source (instead of re-sampling).
  This field is optional for FLAC and WAV audio files, but is
  required for all other audio formats. For details, see AudioEncoding. Defaults to `nil`.
  - speechContexts (list(GoogleApi.Speech.V1.Model.SpeechContext.t)): *Optional* array of SpeechContext.
  A means to provide context to assist the speech recognition. For more
  information, see [Phrase Hints](/speech-to-text/docs/basics#phrase-hints). Defaults to `nil`.
  - useEnhanced (boolean()): *Optional* Set to true to use an enhanced model for speech recognition.
  If `use_enhanced` is set to true and the `model` field is not set, then
  an appropriate enhanced model is chosen if:
  1. project is eligible for requesting enhanced models
  2. an enhanced model exists for the audio

  If `use_enhanced` is true and an enhanced version of the specified model
  does not exist, then the speech is recognized using the standard version
  of the specified model.

  Enhanced speech models require that you opt-in to data logging using
  instructions in the
  [documentation](/speech-to-text/docs/enable-data-logging). If you set
  `use_enhanced` to true and you have not enabled audio logging, then you
  will receive an error. Defaults to `nil`.
