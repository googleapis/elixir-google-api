  @moduledoc """
  Word-specific information for recognized words.

  ## Attributes

  - endTime (String.t): Output only. Time offset relative to the beginning of the audio, and corresponding to the end of the spoken word. This field is only set if &#x60;enable_word_time_offsets&#x3D;true&#x60; and only in the top hypothesis. This is an experimental feature and the accuracy of the time offset can vary. Defaults to: `null`.
  - speakerTag (integer()): Output only. A distinct integer value is assigned for every speaker within the audio. This field specifies which one of those speakers was detected to have spoken this word. Value ranges from &#39;1&#39; to diarization_speaker_count. speaker_tag is set if enable_speaker_diarization &#x3D; &#39;true&#39; and only in the top alternative. Defaults to: `null`.
  - startTime (String.t): Output only. Time offset relative to the beginning of the audio, and corresponding to the start of the spoken word. This field is only set if &#x60;enable_word_time_offsets&#x3D;true&#x60; and only in the top hypothesis. This is an experimental feature and the accuracy of the time offset can vary. Defaults to: `null`.
  - word (String.t): Output only. The word corresponding to this set of information. Defaults to: `null`.
