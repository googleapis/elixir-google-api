defmodule GoogleApi.PlayableLocations.V3.Model.GoogleMapsPlayablelocationsV3SamplePlayableLocationsResponse do
  @moduledoc """
   Response for the SamplePlayableLocations method.

  ## Attributes

  *   `locationsPerGameObjectType` (*type:* `%{optional(String.t) => GoogleApi.PlayableLocations.V3.Model.GoogleMapsPlayablelocationsV3SamplePlayableLocationList.t}`, *default:* `nil`) - Each PlayableLocation object corresponds to a game_object_type specified in the request.
  *   `ttl` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. Specifies the "time-to-live" for the set of playable locations. You can use this value to determine how long to cache the set of playable locations. After this length of time, your back-end game server should issue a new SamplePlayableLocations request to get a fresh set of playable locations (because for example, they might have been removed, a park might have closed for the day, a business might have closed permanently).
