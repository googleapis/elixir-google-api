  Specifies the area to search for playable locations.

  ## Attributes

  *   `s2CellId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The S2 cell ID of the area you want. This must be between cell level 11 and 14 (inclusive). S2 cells are 64-bit integers that identify areas on the Earth. They are hierarchical, and can therefore be used for spatial indexing. The S2 geometry library is available in a number of languages: * [C++](https://github.com/google/s2geometry) * [Java](https://github.com/google/s2-geometry-library-java) * [Go](https://github.com/golang/geo) * [Python](https://github.com/google/s2geometry/tree/master/src/python)
