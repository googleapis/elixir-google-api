defmodule GoogleApi.QPXExpress.V1.Model.FlightInfo do
  @moduledoc """
  A flight is a sequence of legs with the same airline carrier and flight number. (A leg is the smallest unit of travel, in the case of a flight a takeoff immediately followed by a landing at two set points on a particular carrier with a particular flight number.) The naive view is that a flight is scheduled travel of an aircraft between two points, with possibly intermediate stops, but carriers will frequently list flights that require a change of aircraft between legs.
