defmodule GoogleApi.ToolResults.V1beta3.Model.SuggestionClusterProto do
  @moduledoc """
  A set of similar suggestions that we suspect are closely related.

  This proto and most of the nested protos are branched from
  foxandcrown.prelaunchreport.service.SuggestionClusterProto, replacing PLR's
  dependencies with FTL's.

  ## Attributes

  *   `category` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Category in which these types of suggestions should appear.
      Always set.
  *   `suggestions` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.ToolResults.V1beta3.Model.SuggestionProto.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - A sequence of suggestions. All of the suggestions within a cluster must
      have the same SuggestionPriority and belong to the same SuggestionCategory.
      Suggestions with the same screenshot URL should be adjacent.
