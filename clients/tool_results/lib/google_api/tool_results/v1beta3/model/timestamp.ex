defmodule GoogleApi.ToolResults.V1beta3.Model.Timestamp do
  @moduledoc """
  A Timestamp represents a point in time independent of any time zone or local
  calendar, encoded as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at
  nanosecond resolution. The count is relative to an epoch at UTC midnight on
  January 1, 1970, in the proleptic Gregorian calendar which extends the
  Gregorian calendar backwards to year one.

  All minutes are 60 seconds long. Leap seconds are "smeared" so that no leap
  second table is needed for interpretation, using a [24-hour linear
  smear](https://developers.google.com/time/smear).

  The range is from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z. By
  restricting to that range, we ensure that we can convert to and from [RFC
  3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) date strings.

  ## Attributes

  *   `nanos` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Non-negative fractions of a second at nanosecond resolution. Negative
      second values with fractions must still have non-negative nanos values
      that count forward in time. Must be from 0 to 999,999,999
      inclusive.
  *   `seconds` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Represents seconds of UTC time since Unix epoch
      1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. Must be from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to
      9999-12-31T23:59:59Z inclusive.
