defmodule GoogleApi.ToolResults.V1beta3.Model.InconclusiveDetail do
  @moduledoc """
  Details for an outcome with an INCONCLUSIVE outcome summary.

  ## Attributes

  - abortedByUser (boolean()): If the end user aborted the test execution before a pass or fail could be determined. For example, the user pressed ctrl-c which sent a kill signal to the test runner while the test was running. Defaults to `nil`.
  - infrastructureFailure (boolean()): If the test runner could not determine success or failure because the test depends on a component other than the system under test which failed.

  For example, a mobile test requires provisioning a device where the test executes, and that provisioning can fail. Defaults to `nil`.
