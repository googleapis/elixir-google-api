  Request message for EndpointService.UndeployModel.

  ## Attributes

  *   `deployedModelId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The ID of the DeployedModel to be undeployed from the Endpoint.
  *   `trafficSplit` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - If this field is provided, then the Endpoint's traffic_split will be overwritten with it. If last DeployedModel is being undeployed from the Endpoint, the [Endpoint.traffic_split] will always end up empty when this call returns. A DeployedModel will be successfully undeployed only if it doesn't have any traffic assigned to it when this method executes, or if this field unassigns any traffic to it.
