  Prediction output format for Video Action Recognition.

  ## Attributes

  *   `confidence` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - The Model's confidence in correction of this prediction, higher value means higher confidence.
  *   `displayName` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The display name of the AnnotationSpec that had been identified.
  *   `id` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The resource ID of the AnnotationSpec that had been identified.
  *   `timeSegmentEnd` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The end, exclusive, of the video's time segment in which the AnnotationSpec has been identified. Expressed as a number of seconds as measured from the start of the video, with fractions up to a microsecond precision, and with "s" appended at the end.
  *   `timeSegmentStart` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The beginning, inclusive, of the video's time segment in which the AnnotationSpec has been identified. Expressed as a number of seconds as measured from the start of the video, with fractions up to a microsecond precision, and with "s" appended at the end.
