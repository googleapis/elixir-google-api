defmodule GoogleApi.AIPlatform.V1.Model.GoogleCloudAiplatformV1PredefinedSplit do

  Assigns input data to training, validation, and test sets based on the value of a provided key. Supported only for tabular Datasets.

  ## Attributes

  *   `key` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The key is a name of one of the Dataset's data columns. The value of the key (either the label's value or value in the column) must be one of {`training`, `validation`, `test`}, and it defines to which set the given piece of data is assigned. If for a piece of data the key is not present or has an invalid value, that piece is ignored by the pipeline.
