defmodule GoogleApi.AIPlatform.V1.Model.GoogleCloudAiplatformV1CompletionStats do
  @moduledoc """
  Success and error statistics of processing multiple entities (for example, DataItems or structured data rows) in batch.

  ## Attributes

  *   `failedCount` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The number of entities for which any error was encountered.
  *   `incompleteCount` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. In cases when enough errors are encountered a job, pipeline, or operation may be failed as a whole. Below is the number of entities for which the processing had not been finished (either in successful or failed state). Set to -1 if the number is unknown (for example, the operation failed before the total entity number could be collected).
  *   `successfulCount` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The number of entities that had been processed successfully.
  *   `successfulForecastPointCount` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The number of the successful forecast points that are generated by the forecasting model. This is ONLY used by the forecasting batch prediction.
