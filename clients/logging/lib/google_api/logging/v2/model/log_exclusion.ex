defmodule GoogleApi.Logging.V2.Model.LogExclusion do
  @moduledoc """
  Specifies a set of log entries that are filtered out by a sink. If your Google Cloud resource receives a large volume of log entries, you can use exclusions to reduce your chargeable logs. Note that exclusions on organization-level and folder-level sinks don't apply to child resources. Note also that you cannot modify the _Required sink or exclude logs from it.

  ## Attributes

  *   `createTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The creation timestamp of the exclusion.This field may not be present for older exclusions.
  *   `description` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. A description of this exclusion.
  *   `disabled` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. If set to True, then this exclusion is disabled and it does not exclude any log entries. You can update an exclusion to change the value of this field.
  *   `filter` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. An advanced logs filter (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries) that matches the log entries to be excluded. By using the sample function (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries#sample), you can exclude less than 100% of the matching log entries.For example, the following query matches 99% of low-severity log entries from Google Cloud Storage buckets:resource.type=gcs_bucket severity<ERROR sample(insertId, 0.99)
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. A client-assigned identifier, such as "load-balancer-exclusion". Identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only letters, digits, underscores, hyphens, and periods. First character has to be alphanumeric.
  *   `updateTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The last update timestamp of the exclusion.This field may not be present for older exclusions.
