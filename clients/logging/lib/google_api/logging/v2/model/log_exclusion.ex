defmodule GoogleApi.Logging.V2.Model.LogExclusion do
  @moduledoc """
  Specifies a set of log entries that are not to be stored in Stackdriver Logging. If your project receives a large volume of logs, you might be able to use exclusions to reduce your chargeable logs. Exclusions are processed after log sinks, so you can export log entries before they are excluded. Audit log entries and log entries from Amazon Web Services are never excluded.

  ## Attributes

  - description (String.t): Optional. A description of this exclusion. Defaults to: `null`.
  - disabled (boolean()): Optional. If set to True, then this exclusion is disabled and it does not exclude any log entries. You can use exclusions.patch to change the value of this field. Defaults to: `null`.
  - filter (String.t): Required. An advanced logs filter that matches the log entries to be excluded. By using the sample function, you can exclude less than 100% of the matching log entries. For example, the following filter matches 99% of low-severity log entries from load balancers:\&quot;resource.type&#x3D;http_load_balancer severity&lt;ERROR sample(insertId, 0.99)\&quot; Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): Required. A client-assigned identifier, such as \&quot;load-balancer-exclusion\&quot;. Identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only letters, digits, underscores, hyphens, and periods. Defaults to: `null`.
