  *   `lifecycleState` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The bucket lifecycle state.
  *   `locked` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Whether the bucket has been locked. The retention period on a locked bucket may not be changed. Locked buckets may only be deleted if they are empty.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The resource name of the bucket. For example: "projects/my-project-id/locations/my-location/buckets/my-bucket-id The supported locations are: "global"For the location of global it is unspecified where logs are actually stored. Once a bucket has been created, the location can not be changed.
  *   `retentionDays` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Logs will be retained by default for this amount of time, after which they will automatically be deleted. The minimum retention period is 1 day. If this value is set to zero at bucket creation time, the default time of 30 days will be used.
