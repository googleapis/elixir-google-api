defmodule GoogleApi.Logging.V2.Model.LogBucket do
  @moduledoc """
  Describes a repository in which log entries are stored.

  ## Attributes

  *   `cmekSettings` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Logging.V2.Model.CmekSettings.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The CMEK settings of the log bucket. If present, new log entries written to this log bucket are encrypted using the CMEK key provided in this configuration. If a log bucket has CMEK settings, the CMEK settings cannot be disabled later by updating the log bucket. Changing the KMS key is allowed.
  *   `createTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The creation timestamp of the bucket. This is not set for any of the default buckets.
  *   `description` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Describes this bucket.
  *   `lifecycleState` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The bucket lifecycle state.
  *   `locked` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Whether the bucket is locked.The retention period on a locked bucket cannot be changed. Locked buckets may only be deleted if they are empty.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The resource name of the bucket.For example:projects/my-project/locations/global/buckets/my-bucketFor a list of supported locations, see Supported Regions (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/region-support)For the location of global it is unspecified where log entries are actually stored.After a bucket has been created, the location cannot be changed.
  *   `restrictedFields` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Log entry field paths that are denied access in this bucket.The following fields and their children are eligible: textPayload, jsonPayload, protoPayload, httpRequest, labels, sourceLocation.Restricting a repeated field will restrict all values. Adding a parent will block all child fields. (e.g. foo.bar will block foo.bar.baz)
  *   `retentionDays` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Logs will be retained by default for this amount of time, after which they will automatically be deleted. The minimum retention period is 1 day. If this value is set to zero at bucket creation time, the default time of 30 days will be used.
  *   `updateTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The last update timestamp of the bucket.
