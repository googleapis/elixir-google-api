defmodule GoogleApi.Logging.V2.Model.BigQueryOptions do
  @moduledoc """
  Options that change functionality of a sink exporting data to BigQuery.

  ## Attributes

  *   `usePartitionedTables` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. Whether to use BigQuery's partition tables (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables). By default, Cloud Logging creates dated tables based on the log entries' timestamps, e.g. syslog_20170523. With partitioned tables the date suffix is no longer present and special query syntax (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables) has to be used instead. In both cases, tables are sharded based on UTC timezone.
  *   `usesTimestampColumnPartitioning` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. True if new timestamp column based partitioning is in use, false if legacy ingress-time partitioning is in use.All new sinks will have this field set true and will use timestamp column based partitioning. If use_partitioned_tables is false, this value has no meaning and will be false. Legacy sinks using partitioned tables will have this field set to false.
