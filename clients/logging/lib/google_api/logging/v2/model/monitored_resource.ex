defmodule GoogleApi.Logging.V2.Model.MonitoredResource do
  @moduledoc """
  An object representing a resource that can be used for monitoring, logging, billing, or other purposes. Examples include virtual machine instances, databases, and storage devices such as disks. The type field identifies a MonitoredResourceDescriptor object that describes the resource's schema. Information in the labels field identifies the actual resource and its attributes according to the schema. For example, a particular Compute Engine VM instance could be represented by the following object, because the MonitoredResourceDescriptor for "gce_instance" has labels "instance_id" and "zone":
  { "type": "gce_instance",
  "labels": { "instance_id": "12345678901234",
              "zone": "us-central1-a" }}


  ## Attributes

  - labels (map()): Required. Values for all of the labels listed in the associated monitored resource descriptor. For example, Compute Engine VM instances use the labels "project_id", "instance_id", and "zone". Defaults to `nil`.
  - type (String.t): Required. The monitored resource type. This field must match the type field of a MonitoredResourceDescriptor object. For example, the type of a Compute Engine VM instance is gce_instance. Defaults to `nil`.
