defmodule GoogleApi.Logging.V2.Model.MonitoredResource do
  @moduledoc """
  An object representing a resource that can be used for monitoring, logging, billing, or other purposes. Examples include virtual machine instances, databases, and storage devices such as disks. The type field identifies a MonitoredResourceDescriptor object that describes the resource&#39;s schema. Information in the labels field identifies the actual resource and its attributes according to the schema. For example, a particular Compute Engine VM instance could be represented by the following object, because the MonitoredResourceDescriptor for \&quot;gce_instance\&quot; has labels \&quot;instance_id\&quot; and \&quot;zone\&quot;: { \&quot;type\&quot;: \&quot;gce_instance\&quot;,   \&quot;labels\&quot;: { \&quot;instance_id\&quot;: \&quot;12345678901234\&quot;,               \&quot;zone\&quot;: \&quot;us-central1-a\&quot; }}
