defmodule GoogleApi.Logging.V2.Model.LogEntry do
  @moduledoc """
  An individual entry in a log.

  ## Attributes

  - httpRequest (HttpRequest): Optional. Information about the HTTP request associated with this log entry, if applicable. Defaults to: `null`.
  - insertId (String.t): Optional. A unique identifier for the log entry. If you provide a value, then Logging considers other log entries in the same project, with the same timestamp, and with the same insert_id to be duplicates which can be removed. If omitted in new log entries, then Logging assigns its own unique identifier. The insert_id is also used to order log entries that have the same timestamp value. Defaults to: `null`.
  - jsonPayload (%{optional(String.t) &#x3D;&gt; String.t}): The log entry payload, represented as a structure that is expressed as a JSON object. Defaults to: `null`.
  - labels (%{optional(String.t) &#x3D;&gt; String.t}): Optional. A set of user-defined (key, value) data that provides additional information about the log entry. Defaults to: `null`.
  - logName (String.t): Required. The resource name of the log to which this log entry belongs: \&quot;projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]\&quot; \&quot;organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]\&quot; \&quot;billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]\&quot; \&quot;folders/[FOLDER_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]\&quot; A project number may optionally be used in place of PROJECT_ID. The project number is translated to its corresponding PROJECT_ID internally and the log_name field will contain PROJECT_ID in queries and exports.[LOG_ID] must be URL-encoded within log_name. Example: \&quot;organizations/1234567890/logs/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Factivity\&quot;. [LOG_ID] must be less than 512 characters long and can only include the following characters: upper and lower case alphanumeric characters, forward-slash, underscore, hyphen, and period.For backward compatibility, if log_name begins with a forward-slash, such as /projects/..., then the log entry is ingested as usual but the forward-slash is removed. Listing the log entry will not show the leading slash and filtering for a log name with a leading slash will never return any results. Defaults to: `null`.
  - metadata (MonitoredResourceMetadata): Deprecated. Output only. Additional metadata about the monitored resource.Only k8s_container, k8s_pod, and k8s_node MonitoredResources have this field populated for GKE versions older than 1.12.6. For GKE versions 1.12.6 and above, the metadata field has been deprecated. The Kubernetes pod labels that used to be in metadata.userLabels will now be present in the labels field with a key prefix of k8s-pod/. The Stackdriver system labels that were present in the metadata.systemLabels field will no longer be available in the LogEntry. Defaults to: `null`.
  - operation (LogEntryOperation): Optional. Information about an operation associated with the log entry, if applicable. Defaults to: `null`.
  - protoPayload (%{optional(String.t) &#x3D;&gt; String.t}): The log entry payload, represented as a protocol buffer. Some Google Cloud Platform services use this field for their log entry payloads.The following protocol buffer types are supported; user-defined types are not supported:\&quot;type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.audit.AuditLog\&quot;  \&quot;type.googleapis.com/google.appengine.logging.v1.RequestLog\&quot; Defaults to: `null`.
  - receiveTimestamp (DateTime.t): Output only. The time the log entry was received by Logging. Defaults to: `null`.
  - resource (MonitoredResource): Required. The monitored resource that produced this log entry.Example: a log entry that reports a database error would be associated with the monitored resource designating the particular database that reported the error. Defaults to: `null`.
  - severity (String.t): Optional. The severity of the log entry. The default value is LogSeverity.DEFAULT. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [DEFAULT, DEBUG, INFO, NOTICE, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL, ALERT, EMERGENCY]
  - sourceLocation (LogEntrySourceLocation): Optional. Source code location information associated with the log entry, if any. Defaults to: `null`.
  - spanId (String.t): Optional. The span ID within the trace associated with the log entry.For Trace spans, this is the same format that the Trace API v2 uses: a 16-character hexadecimal encoding of an 8-byte array, such as &lt;code&gt;\&quot;000000000000004a\&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - textPayload (String.t): The log entry payload, represented as a Unicode string (UTF-8). Defaults to: `null`.
  - timestamp (DateTime.t): Optional. The time the event described by the log entry occurred. This time is used to compute the log entry&#39;s age and to enforce the logs retention period. If this field is omitted in a new log entry, then Logging assigns it the current time. Timestamps have nanosecond accuracy, but trailing zeros in the fractional seconds might be omitted when the timestamp is displayed.Incoming log entries should have timestamps that are no more than the logs retention period in the past, and no more than 24 hours in the future. Log entries outside those time boundaries will not be available when calling entries.list, but those log entries can still be exported with LogSinks. Defaults to: `null`.
  - trace (String.t): Optional. Resource name of the trace associated with the log entry, if any. If it contains a relative resource name, the name is assumed to be relative to //tracing.googleapis.com. Example: projects/my-projectid/traces/06796866738c859f2f19b7cfb3214824 Defaults to: `null`.
  - traceSampled (boolean()): Optional. The sampling decision of the trace associated with the log entry.True means that the trace resource name in the trace field was sampled for storage in a trace backend. False means that the trace was not sampled for storage when this log entry was written, or the sampling decision was unknown at the time. A non-sampled trace value is still useful as a request correlation identifier. The default is False. Defaults to: `null`.
