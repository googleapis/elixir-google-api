defmodule GoogleApi.RemoteBuildExecution.V2.Model.BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2Command do
  @moduledoc """
  A `Command` is the actual command executed by a worker running an
  Action and specifications of its
  environment.

  Except as otherwise required, the environment (such as which system
  libraries or binaries are available, and what filesystems are mounted where)
  is defined by and specific to the implementation of the remote execution API.

  ## Attributes

  *   `arguments` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The arguments to the command. The first argument must be the path to the
      executable, which must be either a relative path, in which case it is
      evaluated with respect to the input root, or an absolute path.
  *   `environmentVariables` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.RemoteBuildExecution.V2.Model.BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2CommandEnvironmentVariable.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The environment variables to set when running the program. The worker may
      provide its own default environment variables; these defaults can be
      overridden using this field. Additional variables can also be specified.

      In order to ensure that equivalent
      Commands always hash to the same
      value, the environment variables MUST be lexicographically sorted by name.
      Sorting of strings is done by code point, equivalently, by the UTF-8 bytes.
  *   `outputDirectories` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - A list of the output directories that the client expects to retrieve from
      the action. Only the listed directories will be returned (an entire
      directory structure will be returned as a
      Tree message digest, see
      OutputDirectory), as
      well as files listed in `output_files`. Other files or directories that
      may be created during command execution are discarded.

      The paths are relative to the working directory of the action execution.
      The paths are specified using a single forward slash (`/`) as a path
      separator, even if the execution platform natively uses a different
      separator. The path MUST NOT include a trailing slash, nor a leading slash,
      being a relative path. The special value of empty string is allowed,
      although not recommended, and can be used to capture the entire working
      directory tree, including inputs.

      In order to ensure consistent hashing of the same Action, the output paths
      MUST be sorted lexicographically by code point (or, equivalently, by UTF-8
      bytes).

      An output directory cannot be duplicated or have the same path as any of
      the listed output files. An output directory is allowed to be a parent of
      another output directory.

      Directories leading up to the output directories (but not the output
      directories themselves) are created by the worker prior to execution, even
      if they are not explicitly part of the input root.

      DEPRECATED since 2.1: Use `output_paths` instead.
  *   `outputFiles` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - A list of the output files that the client expects to retrieve from the
      action. Only the listed files, as well as directories listed in
      `output_directories`, will be returned to the client as output.
      Other files or directories that may be created during command execution
      are discarded.

      The paths are relative to the working directory of the action execution.
      The paths are specified using a single forward slash (`/`) as a path
      separator, even if the execution platform natively uses a different
      separator. The path MUST NOT include a trailing slash, nor a leading slash,
      being a relative path.

      In order to ensure consistent hashing of the same Action, the output paths
      MUST be sorted lexicographically by code point (or, equivalently, by UTF-8
      bytes).

      An output file cannot be duplicated, be a parent of another output file, or
      have the same path as any of the listed output directories.

      Directories leading up to the output files are created by the worker prior
      to execution, even if they are not explicitly part of the input root.

      DEPRECATED since v2.1: Use `output_paths` instead.
  *   `outputPaths` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - A list of the output paths that the client expects to retrieve from the
      action. Only the listed paths will be returned to the client as output.
      The type of the output (file or directory) is not specified, and will be
      determined by the server after action execution. If the resulting path is
      a file, it will be returned in an
      OutputFile) typed field.
      If the path is a directory, the entire directory structure will be returned
      as a Tree message digest, see
      OutputDirectory)
      Other files or directories that may be created during command execution
      are discarded.

      The paths are relative to the working directory of the action execution.
      The paths are specified using a single forward slash (`/`) as a path
      separator, even if the execution platform natively uses a different
      separator. The path MUST NOT include a trailing slash, nor a leading slash,
      being a relative path.

      In order to ensure consistent hashing of the same Action, the output paths
      MUST be deduplicated and sorted lexicographically by code point (or,
      equivalently, by UTF-8 bytes).

      Directories leading up to the output paths are created by the worker prior
      to execution, even if they are not explicitly part of the input root.

      New in v2.1: this field supersedes the DEPRECATED `output_files` and
      `output_directories` fields. If `output_paths` is used, `output_files` and
      `output_directories` will be ignored!
  *   `platform` (*type:* `GoogleApi.RemoteBuildExecution.V2.Model.BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2Platform.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The platform requirements for the execution environment. The server MAY
      choose to execute the action on any worker satisfying the requirements, so
      the client SHOULD ensure that running the action on any such worker will
      have the same result.
      A detailed lexicon for this can be found in the accompanying platform.md.
  *   `workingDirectory` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The working directory, relative to the input root, for the command to run
      in. It must be a directory which exists in the input tree. If it is left
      empty, then the action is run in the input root.
