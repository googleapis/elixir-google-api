defmodule GoogleApi.RemoteBuildExecution.V2.Model.GoogleDevtoolsRemoteworkersV1test2Digest do
  @moduledoc """
  The CommandTask and CommandResult messages assume the existence of a service that can serve blobs of content, identified by a hash and size known as a "digest." The method by which these blobs may be retrieved is not specified here, but a model implementation is in the Remote Execution API's "ContentAddressibleStorage" interface. In the context of the RWAPI, a Digest will virtually always refer to the contents of a file or a directory. The latter is represented by the byte-encoded Directory message.

  ## Attributes

  *   `hash` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A string-encoded hash (eg "1a2b3c", not the byte array [0x1a, 0x2b, 0x3c]) using an implementation-defined hash algorithm (eg SHA-256).
  *   `sizeBytes` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The size of the contents. While this is not strictly required as part of an identifier (after all, any given hash will have exactly one canonical size), it's useful in almost all cases when one might want to send or retrieve blobs of content and is included here for this reason.
