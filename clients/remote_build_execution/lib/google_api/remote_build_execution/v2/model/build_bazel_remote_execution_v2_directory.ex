defmodule GoogleApi.RemoteBuildExecution.V2.Model.BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2Directory do
  @moduledoc """
  A `Directory` represents a directory node in a file tree, containing zero or
  more children FileNodes,
  DirectoryNodes and
  SymlinkNodes.
  Each `Node` contains its name in the directory, either the digest of its
  content (either a file blob or a `Directory` proto) or a symlink target, as
  well as possibly some metadata about the file or directory.

  In order to ensure that two equivalent directory trees hash to the same
  value, the following restrictions MUST be obeyed when constructing a
  a `Directory`:

  * Every child in the directory must have a path of exactly one segment.
    Multiple levels of directory hierarchy may not be collapsed.
  * Each child in the directory must have a unique path segment (file name).
    Note that while the API itself is case-sensitive, the environment where
    the Action is executed may or may not be case-sensitive. That is, it is
    legal to call the API with a Directory that has both "Foo" and "foo" as
    children, but the Action may be rejected by the remote system upon
    execution.
  * The files, directories and symlinks in the directory must each be sorted
    in lexicographical order by path. The path strings must be sorted by code
    point, equivalently, by UTF-8 bytes.
  * The NodeProperties of files,
    directories, and symlinks must be sorted in lexicographical order by
    property name.

  A `Directory` that obeys the restrictions is said to be in canonical form.

  As an example, the following could be used for a file named `bar` and a
  directory named `foo` with an executable file named `baz` (hashes shortened
  for readability):

  ```json
  // (Directory proto)
  {
    files: [
      {
        name: "bar",
        digest: {
          hash: "4a73bc9d03...",
          size: 65534
        },
        node_properties: [
          {
            "name": "MTime",
            "value": "2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    directories: [
      {
        name: "foo",
        digest: {
          hash: "4cf2eda940...",
          size: 43
        }
      }
    ]
  }

  // (Directory proto with hash "4cf2eda940..." and size 43)
  {
    files: [
      {
        name: "baz",
        digest: {
          hash: "b2c941073e...",
          size: 1294,
        },
        is_executable: true
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
