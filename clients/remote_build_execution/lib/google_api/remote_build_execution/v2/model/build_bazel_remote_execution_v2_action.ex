defmodule GoogleApi.RemoteBuildExecution.V2.Model.BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2Action do
  @moduledoc """
  An `Action` captures all the information about an execution which is required
  to reproduce it.

  `Action`s are the core component of the [Execution] service. A single
  `Action` represents a repeatable action that can be performed by the
  execution service. `Action`s can be succinctly identified by the digest of
  their wire format encoding and, once an `Action` has been executed, will be
  cached in the action cache. Future requests can then use the cached result
  rather than needing to run afresh.

  When a server completes execution of an
  Action, it MAY choose to
  cache the result in
  the ActionCache unless
  `do_not_cache` is `true`. Clients SHOULD expect the server to do so. By
  default, future calls to
  Execute the same
  `Action` will also serve their results from the cache. Clients must take care
  to understand the caching behaviour. Ideally, all `Action`s will be
  reproducible so that serving a result from cache is always desirable and
  correct.

  ## Attributes

  *   `commandDigest` (*type:* `GoogleApi.RemoteBuildExecution.V2.Model.BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2Digest.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The digest of the Command
      to run, which MUST be present in the
      ContentAddressableStorage.
  *   `doNotCache` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - If true, then the `Action`'s result cannot be cached, and in-flight
      requests for the same `Action` may not be merged.
  *   `inputRootDigest` (*type:* `GoogleApi.RemoteBuildExecution.V2.Model.BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2Digest.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The digest of the root
      Directory for the input
      files. The files in the directory tree are available in the correct
      location on the build machine before the command is executed. The root
      directory, as well as every subdirectory and content blob referred to, MUST
      be in the
      ContentAddressableStorage.
  *   `timeout` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A timeout after which the execution should be killed. If the timeout is
      absent, then the client is specifying that the execution should continue
      as long as the server will let it. The server SHOULD impose a timeout if
      the client does not specify one, however, if the client does specify a
      timeout that is longer than the server's maximum timeout, the server MUST
      reject the request.

      The timeout is a part of the
      Action message, and
      therefore two `Actions` with different timeouts are different, even if they
      are otherwise identical. This is because, if they were not, running an
      `Action` with a lower timeout than is required might result in a cache hit
      from an execution run with a longer timeout, hiding the fact that the
      timeout is too short. By encoding it directly in the `Action`, a lower
      timeout will result in a cache miss and the execution timeout will fail
      immediately, rather than whenever the cache entry gets evicted.
