defmodule GoogleApi.RemoteBuildExecution.V2.Model.BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2ResultsCachePolicy do
  @moduledoc """
  A `ResultsCachePolicy` is used for fine-grained control over how action outputs are stored in the CAS and Action Cache.

  ## Attributes

  *   `priority` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - The priority (relative importance) of this content in the overall cache. Generally, a lower value means a longer retention time or other advantage, but the interpretation of a given value is server-dependent. A priority of 0 means a *default* value, decided by the server. The particular semantics of this field is up to the server. In particular, every server will have their own supported range of priorities, and will decide how these map into retention/eviction policy.
