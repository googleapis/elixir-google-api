defmodule GoogleApi.CloudScheduler.V1.Model.PubsubMessage do
  @moduledoc """
  A message that is published by publishers and consumed by subscribers. The message must contain either a non-empty data field or at least one attribute. Note that client libraries represent this object differently depending on the language. See the corresponding [client library documentation](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/libraries) for more information. See [quotas and limits] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/quotas) for more information about message limits.

  ## Attributes

  *   `attributes` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - Attributes for this message. If this field is empty, the message must contain non-empty data. This can be used to filter messages on the subscription.
  *   `data` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The message data field. If this field is empty, the message must contain at least one attribute.
  *   `messageId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - ID of this message, assigned by the server when the message is published. Guaranteed to be unique within the topic. This value may be read by a subscriber that receives a `PubsubMessage` via a `Pull` call or a push delivery. It must not be populated by the publisher in a `Publish` call.
  *   `orderingKey` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - If non-empty, identifies related messages for which publish order should be respected. If a `Subscription` has `enable_message_ordering` set to `true`, messages published with the same non-empty `ordering_key` value will be delivered to subscribers in the order in which they are received by the Pub/Sub system. All `PubsubMessage`s published in a given `PublishRequest` must specify the same `ordering_key` value. For more information, see [ordering messages](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/ordering).
  *   `publishTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The time at which the message was published, populated by the server when it receives the `Publish` call. It must not be populated by the publisher in a `Publish` call.
