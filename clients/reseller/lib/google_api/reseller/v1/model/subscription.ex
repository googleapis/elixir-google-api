  *   `resourceUiUrl` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - URL to customer's Subscriptions page in the Admin console. The read-only URL is generated by the API service. This is used if your client application requires the customer to complete a task using the Subscriptions page in the Admin console.
  *   `seats` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Reseller.V1.Model.Seats.t`, *default:* `nil`) - This is a required property. The number and limit of user seat licenses in the plan.
  *   `skuId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A required property. The skuId is a unique system identifier for a product's SKU assigned to a customer in the subscription. For products and SKUs available in this version of the API, see  Product and SKU IDs.

  *   `subscriptionId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The subscriptionId is the subscription identifier and is unique for each customer. This is a required property.

      - RENEWAL_WITH_TYPE_CANCEL - The customer's commitment ended and their service was cancelled at the end of their term.  
      - RESELLER_INITIATED - A manual suspension invoked by a Reseller.  
      - TRIAL_ENDED - The customer's trial expired without a plan selected.  
      - OTHER - The customer is suspended for an internal Google reason (e.g. abuse or otherwise).
  *   `transferInfo` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Reseller.V1.Model.SubscriptionTransferInfo.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Read-only transfer related information for the subscription. For more information, see retrieve transferable subscriptions for a customer.
