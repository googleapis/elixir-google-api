  ## Attributes

  - dealCode (String.t): Google-issued code (100 char max) for discounted pricing on subscription plans. Deal code must be included in changePlan request in order to receive discounted rate. This property is optional. If a deal code has already been added to a subscription, this property may be left empty and the existing discounted rate will still apply (if not empty, only provide the deal code that is already present on the subscription). If a deal code has never been added to a subscription and this property is left blank, regular pricing will apply. Defaults to `nil`.
