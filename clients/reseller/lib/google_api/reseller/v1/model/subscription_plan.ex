defmodule GoogleApi.Reseller.V1.Model.SubscriptionPlan do
  @moduledoc """
  The plan property is required. In this version of the API, the G Suite plans are the flexible plan, annual commitment plan, and the 30-day free trial plan. For more information about the API\&quot;s payment plans, see the API concepts.

  ## Attributes

  - commitmentInterval (SubscriptionPlanCommitmentInterval):  Defaults to: `null`.
  - isCommitmentPlan (boolean()): The isCommitmentPlan property&#39;s boolean value identifies the plan as an annual commitment plan: - true — The subscription&#39;s plan is an annual commitment plan. - false — The plan is not an annual commitment plan. Defaults to: `null`.
  - planName (String.t): The planName property is required. This is the name of the subscription&#39;s plan. For more information about the Google payment plans, see the API concepts.  Possible values are:   - ANNUAL_MONTHLY_PAY — The annual commitment plan with monthly payments   - ANNUAL_YEARLY_PAY — The annual commitment plan with yearly payments   - FLEXIBLE — The flexible plan   - TRIAL — The 30-day free trial plan. A subscription in trial will be suspended after the 30th free day if no payment plan is assigned. Calling changePlan will assign a payment plan to a trial but will not activate the plan. A trial will automatically begin its assigned payment plan after its 30th free day or immediately after calling startPaidService. Defaults to: `null`.
