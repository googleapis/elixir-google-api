defmodule GoogleApi.Reseller.V1.Model.Seats do
  @moduledoc """
  JSON template for subscription seats.

  ## Attributes

  *   `kind` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `subscriptions#seats`) - Identifies the resource as a subscription seat setting. Value: `subscriptions#seats`
  *   `licensedNumberOfSeats` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Read-only field containing the current number of users that are assigned a license for the product defined in `skuId`. This field's value is equivalent to the numerical count of users returned by the Enterprise License Manager API method: [`listForProductAndSku`](/admin-sdk/licensing/v1/reference/licenseAssignments/listForProductAndSku).
  *   `maximumNumberOfSeats` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - This is a required property and is exclusive to subscriptions with `FLEXIBLE` or `TRIAL` plans. This property sets the maximum number of licensed users allowed on a subscription. This quantity can be increased up to the maximum limit defined in the reseller's contract. The minimum quantity is the current number of users in the customer account. *Note: *G Suite subscriptions automatically assign a license to every user.
  *   `numberOfSeats` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - This is a required property and is exclusive to subscriptions with `ANNUAL_MONTHLY_PAY` and `ANNUAL_YEARLY_PAY` plans. This property sets the maximum number of licenses assignable to users on a subscription. The reseller can add more licenses, but once set, the `numberOfSeats` cannot be reduced until renewal. The reseller is invoiced based on the `numberOfSeats` value regardless of how many of these user licenses are assigned. *Note: *Google Workspace subscriptions automatically assign a license to every user.
