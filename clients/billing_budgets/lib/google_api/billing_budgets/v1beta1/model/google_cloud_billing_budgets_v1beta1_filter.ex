  @moduledoc """
  A filter for a budget, limiting the scope of the cost to calculate.

  ## Attributes

  *   `creditTypesTreatment` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. If not set, default behavior is `INCLUDE_ALL_CREDITS`.
  *   `labels` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. A single label and value pair specifying that usage from only this set of
      labeled resources should be included in the budget. Multiple entries or
      multiple values per entry are not allowed. If omitted, the report will
      include all labeled and unlabeled usage.
  *   `projects` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. A set of projects of the form `projects/{project}`,
      specifying that usage from only this set of projects should be
      included in the budget. If omitted, the report will include all usage for
      the billing account, regardless of which project the usage occurred on.
      Only zero or one project can be specified currently.
  *   `services` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. A set of services of the form `services/{service_id}`,
      specifying that usage from only this set of services should be
      included in the budget. If omitted, the report will include usage for
      all the services.
      The service names are available through the Catalog API:
      https://cloud.google.com/billing/v1/how-tos/catalog-api.
  *   `subaccounts` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. A set of subaccounts of the form `billingAccounts/{account_id}`, specifying
      that usage from only this set of subaccounts should be included in the
      budget. If a subaccount is set to the name of the master account, usage
      from the master account will be included. If omitted, the report will
      include usage from the master account and all subaccounts, if they exist.
