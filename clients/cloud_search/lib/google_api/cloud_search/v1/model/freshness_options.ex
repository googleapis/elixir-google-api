defmodule GoogleApi.CloudSearch.V1.Model.FreshnessOptions do
  @moduledoc """
  Indicates which freshness property to use when adjusting search ranking for
  an item. Fresher, more recent dates indicate higher quality. Use the
  freshness option property that best works with your data. For fileshare
  documents, last modified time is most relevant. For calendar event data,
  the time when the event occurs is a more relevant freshness indicator. In
  this way, calendar events that occur closer to the time of the search query
  are considered higher quality and ranked accordingly.

  ## Attributes

  *   `freshnessDuration` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The duration after which an object should be considered
      stale. The default value is 180 days (in seconds).
  *   `freshnessProperty` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - This property indicates the freshness level of the object in the index.
      If set, this property must be a top-level property within the
      property definitions
      and it must be a
      timestamp type
      or
      date type.
      Otherwise, the Indexing API uses
      updateTime
      as the freshness indicator.
      The maximum length is 256 characters.

      When a property is used to calculate fresheness, the value defaults
      to 2 years from the current time.
