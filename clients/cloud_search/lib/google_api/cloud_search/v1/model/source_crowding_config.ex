defmodule GoogleApi.CloudSearch.V1.Model.SourceCrowdingConfig do
  @moduledoc """
  Set search results crowding limits. Crowding is a situation in which multiple results from the same source or host "crowd out" other results, diminishing the quality of search for users. To foster better search quality and source diversity in search results, you can set a condition to reduce repetitive results by source.

  ## Attributes

  *   `numResults` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Maximum number of results allowed from a source. No limits will be set on results if this value is less than or equal to 0.
  *   `numSuggestions` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Maximum number of suggestions allowed from a source. No limits will be set on results if this value is less than or equal to 0.
