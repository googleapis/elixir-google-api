defmodule GoogleApi.CloudSearch.V1.Model.DateOperatorOptions do
  @moduledoc """
  Optional. Provides a search operator for date properties.
  Search operators let users restrict the query to specific fields relevant
  to the type of item being searched.

  ## Attributes

  *   `greaterThanOperatorName` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Indicates the operator name required in the query in order to isolate the
      date property using the greater-than operator. For example, if
      greaterThanOperatorName is *closedafter* and the property's name is
      *closeDate*, then queries like *closedafter:&lt;value&gt;* will
      show results only where the value of the property named *closeDate* is
      later than *&lt;value&gt;*.
      The operator name can only contain lowercase letters (a-z).
      The maximum length is 32 characters.
  *   `lessThanOperatorName` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Indicates the operator name required in the query in order to isolate the
      date property using the less-than operator. For example, if
      lessThanOperatorName is *closedbefore* and the property's name is
      *closeDate*, then queries like *closedbefore:&lt;value&gt;* will
      show results only where the value of the property named *closeDate* is
      earlier than *&lt;value&gt;*.
      The operator name can only contain lowercase letters (a-z).
      The maximum length is 32 characters.
  *   `operatorName` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Indicates the actual string required in the query in order to isolate the
      date property. For example, suppose an issue tracking schema object
      has a property named *closeDate* that specifies an operator with an
      operatorName of *closedon*. For searches on that data, queries like
      *closedon:&lt;value&gt;* will show results only where the value of the
      *closeDate* property matches *&lt;value&gt;*. By contrast, a
      search that uses the same *&lt;value&gt;* without an operator will return
      all items where *&lt;value&gt;* matches the value of any String
      properties or text within the content field for the indexed datasource.
      The operator name can only contain lowercase letters (a-z).
      The maximum length is 32 characters.
