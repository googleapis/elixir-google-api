  *   `detailedLeadReports` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.LocalServices.V1.Model.GoogleAdsHomeservicesLocalservicesV1DetailedLeadReport.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - List of detailed lead reports uniquely identified by external lead id.
  *   `nextPageToken` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Pagination token to retrieve the next page of results. When `next_page_token` is not filled in, there is no next page and the list returned is the last page in the result set.
