  Specification of traffic source attributes.

  ## Attributes

  *   `ipBlocks` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. List of CIDR ranges to match based on source IP address. At least one IP block should match. Single IP (e.g., "1.2.3.4") and CIDR (e.g., "1.2.3.0/24") are supported. Authorization based on source IP alone should be avoided. The IP addresses of any load balancers or proxies should be considered untrusted.
  *   `principals` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. List of peer identities to match for authorization. At least one principal should match. Each peer can be an exact match, or a prefix match (example, "namespace/*") or a suffix match (example, "*/service-account") or a presence match "*". Authorization based on the principal name without certificate validation (configured by ServerTlsPolicy resource) is considered insecure.
