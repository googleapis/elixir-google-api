defmodule GoogleApi.SafeBrowsing.V4.Model.RawHashes do
  @moduledoc """
  The uncompressed threat entries in hash format of a particular prefix length.
  Hashes can be anywhere from 4 to 32 bytes in size. A large majority are 4
  bytes, but some hashes are lengthened if they collide with the hash of a
  popular URL.

  Used for sending ThreatEntrySet to clients that do not support compression,
  or when sending non-4-byte hashes to clients that do support compression.

  ## Attributes

  *   `prefixSize` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - The number of bytes for each prefix encoded below.  This field can be
      anywhere from 4 (shortest prefix) to 32 (full SHA256 hash).
  *   `rawHashes` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The hashes, in binary format, concatenated into one long string. Hashes are
      sorted in lexicographic order. For JSON API users, hashes are
      base64-encoded.
