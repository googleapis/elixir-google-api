# GoogleApi.SafeBrowsing

Safe Browsing API client library.

Enables client applications to check web resources (most commonly URLs) against Google-generated lists of unsafe web resources. The Safe Browsing APIs are for non-commercial use only. If you need to use APIs to detect malicious URLs for commercial purposes – meaning “for sale or revenue-generating purposes” – please refer to the Web Risk API.
