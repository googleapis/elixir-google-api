  ## Attributes

  - activeUnits (String.t): Total number of units currently being processed by workers. This does not correspond directly to slot usage. This is the largest value observed since the last sample. Defaults to: `null`.
  - completedUnits (String.t): Total parallel units of work completed by this query. Defaults to: `null`.
  - elapsedMs (String.t): Milliseconds elapsed since the start of query execution. Defaults to: `null`.
  - pendingUnits (String.t): Total parallel units of work remaining for the active stages. Defaults to: `null`.
  - totalSlotMs (String.t): Cumulative slot-ms consumed by the query. Defaults to: `null`.
