  ## Attributes

  - durationMs (String.t): [Output-only, Beta] Time taken to run the training iteration in milliseconds. Defaults to `nil`.
  - evalLoss (float()): [Output-only, Beta] Eval loss computed on the eval data at the end of the iteration. The eval loss is used for early stopping to avoid overfitting. No eval loss if eval_split_method option is specified as no_split or auto_split with input data size less than 500 rows. Defaults to `nil`.
  - index (integer()): [Output-only, Beta] Index of the ML training iteration, starting from zero for each training run. Defaults to `nil`.
  - learnRate (float()): [Output-only, Beta] Learning rate used for this iteration, it varies for different training iterations if learn_rate_strategy option is not constant. Defaults to `nil`.
  - trainingLoss (float()): [Output-only, Beta] Training loss computed on the training data at the end of the iteration. The training loss function is defined by model type. Defaults to `nil`.
