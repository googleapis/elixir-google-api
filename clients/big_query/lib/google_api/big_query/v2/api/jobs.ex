  Requests that a job be cancelled. This call will return immediately, and the client will need to poll for the job status to see if the cancel completed successfully. Cancelled jobs may still incur costs.

  ## Parameters

  - connection (GoogleApi.BigQuery.V2.Connection): Connection to server
  - project_id (String): [Required] Project ID of the job to cancel
  - job_id (String): [Required] Job ID of the job to cancel
  - opts (KeywordList): [optional] Optional parameters
    - :alt (String): Data format for the response.
    - :fields (String): Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
    - :key (String): API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
    - :oauth_token (String): OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
    - :pretty_print (Boolean): Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
    - :quota_user (String): Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters. Overrides userIp if both are provided.
    - :user_ip (String): IP address of the site where the request originates. Use this if you want to enforce per-user limits.
