  SecurityBulletinEvent is a notification sent to customers when a security bulletin has been posted that they are vulnerable to.

  ## Attributes

  *   `affectedSupportedMinors` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The GKE minor versions affected by this vulnerability.
  *   `briefDescription` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A brief description of the bulletin. See the bulletin pointed to by the bulletin_uri field for an expanded description.
  *   `bulletinId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The ID of the bulletin corresponding to the vulnerability.
  *   `bulletinUri` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The URI link to the bulletin on the website for more information.
  *   `cveIds` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The CVEs associated with this bulletin.
  *   `manualStepsRequired` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - If this field is specified, it means there are manual steps that the user must take to make their clusters safe.
  *   `patchedVersions` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The GKE versions where this vulnerability is patched.
  *   `resourceTypeAffected` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The resource type (node/control plane) that has the vulnerability. Multiple notifications (1 notification per resource type) will be sent for a vulnerability that affects > 1 resource type.
  *   `severity` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The severity of this bulletin as it relates to GKE.
  *   `suggestedUpgradeTarget` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - This represents a version selected from the patched_versions field that the cluster receiving this notification should most likely want to upgrade to based on its current version. Note that if this notification is being received by a given cluster, it means that this version is currently available as an upgrade target in that cluster's location.
