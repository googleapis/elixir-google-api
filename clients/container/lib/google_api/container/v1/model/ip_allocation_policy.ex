defmodule GoogleApi.Container.V1.Model.IPAllocationPolicy do
  @moduledoc """
  Configuration for controlling how IPs are allocated in the cluster.

  ## Attributes

  - clusterIpv4Cidr (String.t): This field is deprecated, use cluster_ipv4_cidr_block. Defaults to `nil`.
  - clusterIpv4CidrBlock (String.t): The IP address range for the cluster pod IPs. If this field is set, then
  `cluster.cluster_ipv4_cidr` must be left blank.

  This field is only applicable when `use_ip_aliases` is true.

  Set to blank to have a range chosen with the default size.

  Set to /netmask (e.g. `/14`) to have a range chosen with a specific
  netmask.

  Set to a
  [CIDR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing)
  notation (e.g. `10.96.0.0/14`) from the RFC-1918 private networks (e.g.
  `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`) to pick a specific range
  to use. Defaults to `nil`.
  - clusterSecondaryRangeName (String.t): The name of the secondary range to be used for the cluster CIDR
  block.  The secondary range will be used for pod IP
  addresses. This must be an existing secondary range associated
  with the cluster subnetwork.

  This field is only applicable with use_ip_aliases is true and
  create_subnetwork is false. Defaults to `nil`.
  - createSubnetwork (boolean()): Whether a new subnetwork will be created automatically for the cluster.

  This field is only applicable when `use_ip_aliases` is true. Defaults to `nil`.
  - nodeIpv4Cidr (String.t): This field is deprecated, use node_ipv4_cidr_block. Defaults to `nil`.
  - nodeIpv4CidrBlock (String.t): The IP address range of the instance IPs in this cluster.

  This is applicable only if `create_subnetwork` is true.

  Set to blank to have a range chosen with the default size.

  Set to /netmask (e.g. `/14`) to have a range chosen with a specific
  netmask.

  Set to a
  [CIDR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing)
  notation (e.g. `10.96.0.0/14`) from the RFC-1918 private networks (e.g.
  `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`) to pick a specific range
  to use. Defaults to `nil`.
  - servicesIpv4Cidr (String.t): This field is deprecated, use services_ipv4_cidr_block. Defaults to `nil`.
  - servicesIpv4CidrBlock (String.t): The IP address range of the services IPs in this cluster. If blank, a range
  will be automatically chosen with the default size.

  This field is only applicable when `use_ip_aliases` is true.

  Set to blank to have a range chosen with the default size.

  Set to /netmask (e.g. `/14`) to have a range chosen with a specific
  netmask.

  Set to a
  [CIDR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing)
  notation (e.g. `10.96.0.0/14`) from the RFC-1918 private networks (e.g.
  `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`) to pick a specific range
  to use. Defaults to `nil`.
  - servicesSecondaryRangeName (String.t): The name of the secondary range to be used as for the services
  CIDR block.  The secondary range will be used for service
  ClusterIPs. This must be an existing secondary range associated
  with the cluster subnetwork.

  This field is only applicable with use_ip_aliases is true and
  create_subnetwork is false. Defaults to `nil`.
  - subnetworkName (String.t): A custom subnetwork name to be used if `create_subnetwork` is true.  If
  this field is empty, then an automatic name will be chosen for the new
  subnetwork. Defaults to `nil`.
  - tpuIpv4CidrBlock (String.t): The IP address range of the Cloud TPUs in this cluster. If unspecified, a
  range will be automatically chosen with the default size.

  This field is only applicable when `use_ip_aliases` is true.

  If unspecified, the range will use the default size.

  Set to /netmask (e.g. `/14`) to have a range chosen with a specific
  netmask.

  Set to a
  [CIDR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing)
  notation (e.g. `10.96.0.0/14`) from the RFC-1918 private networks (e.g.
  `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`) to pick a specific range
  to use. Defaults to `nil`.
  - useIpAliases (boolean()): Whether alias IPs will be used for pod IPs in the cluster. Defaults to `nil`.
