defmodule GoogleApi.Container.V1.Model.UpgradeSettings do
  @moduledoc """
  These upgrade settings control the level of parallelism and the level of
  disruption caused by an upgrade.

  maxUnavailable controls the number of nodes that can be simultaneously
  unavailable.

  maxSurge controls the number of additional nodes that can be added to the
  node pool temporarily for the time of the upgrade to increase the number of
  available nodes.

  (maxUnavailable + maxSurge) determines the level of parallelism (how many
  nodes are being upgraded at the same time).

  Note: upgrades inevitably introduce some disruption since workloads need to
  be moved from old nodes to new, upgraded ones. Even if maxUnavailable=0,
  this holds true. (Disruption stays within the limits of
  PodDisruptionBudget, if it is configured.)

  Consider a hypothetical node pool with 5 nodes having maxSurge=2,
  maxUnavailable=1. This means the upgrade process upgrades 3 nodes
  simultaneously. It creates 2 additional (upgraded) nodes, then it brings
  down 3 old (not yet upgraded) nodes at the same time. This ensures that
  there are always at least 4 nodes available.

  ## Attributes

  *   `maxSurge` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - The maximum number of nodes that can be created beyond the current size
      of the node pool during the upgrade process.
  *   `maxUnavailable` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - The maximum number of nodes that can be simultaneously unavailable during
      the upgrade process. A node is considered available if its status is
      Ready.
