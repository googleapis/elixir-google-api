defmodule GoogleApi.Container.V1.Model.NodePool do
  @moduledoc """
  NodePool contains the name and configuration for a cluster&#39;s node pool. Node pools are a set of nodes (i.e. VM&#39;s), with a common configuration and specification, under the control of the cluster master. They may have a set of Kubernetes labels applied to them, which may be used to reference them during pod scheduling. They may also be resized up or down, to accommodate the workload.

  ## Attributes

  - autoscaling (NodePoolAutoscaling): Autoscaler configuration for this NodePool. Autoscaler is enabled only if a valid configuration is present. Defaults to: `null`.
  - config (NodeConfig): The node configuration of the pool. Defaults to: `null`.
  - initialNodeCount (Integer): The initial node count for the pool. You must ensure that your Compute Engine &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;/compute/docs/resource-quotas\&quot;&gt;resource quota&lt;/a&gt; is sufficient for this number of instances. You must also have available firewall and routes quota. Defaults to: `null`.
  - instanceGroupUrls (List[String]): [Output only] The resource URLs of [instance groups](/compute/docs/instance-groups/) associated with this node pool. Defaults to: `null`.
  - management (NodeManagement): NodeManagement configuration for this NodePool. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String): The name of the node pool. Defaults to: `null`.
  - selfLink (String): [Output only] Server-defined URL for the resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - status (String): [Output only] The status of the nodes in this pool instance. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [STATUS_UNSPECIFIED, PROVISIONING, RUNNING, RUNNING_WITH_ERROR, RECONCILING, STOPPING, ERROR]
  - statusMessage (String): [Output only] Additional information about the current status of this node pool instance, if available. Defaults to: `null`.
  - version (String): [Output only] The version of the Kubernetes of this node. Defaults to: `null`.
