defmodule GoogleApi.Redis.V1beta1.Model.Instance do
  @moduledoc """
  A Google Cloud Redis instance.

  ## Attributes

  - alternativeLocationId (String.t): Optional. Only applicable to STANDARD_HA tier which protects the instance
  against zonal failures by provisioning it across two zones. If provided, it
  must be a different zone from the one provided in [location_id]. Defaults to `nil`.
  - authorizedNetwork (String.t): Optional. The full name of the Google Compute Engine
  [network](/compute/docs/networks-and-firewalls#networks) to which the
  instance is connected. If left unspecified, the `default` network
  will be used. Defaults to `nil`.
  - createTime (DateTime.t): Output only. The time the instance was created. Defaults to `nil`.
  - currentLocationId (String.t): Output only. The current zone where the Redis endpoint is placed. For Basic
  Tier instances, this will always be the same as the [location_id]
  provided by the user at creation time. For Standard Tier instances,
  this can be either [location_id] or [alternative_location_id] and can
  change after a failover event. Defaults to `nil`.
  - displayName (String.t): An arbitrary and optional user-provided name for the instance. Defaults to `nil`.
  - host (String.t): Output only. Hostname or IP address of the exposed Redis endpoint used by
  clients to connect to the service. Defaults to `nil`.
  - labels (map()): Resource labels to represent user provided metadata Defaults to `nil`.
  - locationId (String.t): Optional. The zone where the instance will be provisioned. If not provided,
  the service will choose a zone for the instance. For STANDARD_HA tier,
  instances will be created across two zones for protection against zonal
  failures. If [alternative_location_id] is also provided, it must be
  different from [location_id]. Defaults to `nil`.
  - memorySizeGb (integer()): Required. Redis memory size in GiB. Defaults to `nil`.
  - name (String.t): Required. Unique name of the resource in this scope including project and
  location using the form:
    `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}`

  Note: Redis instances are managed and addressed at regional level so
  location_id here refers to a GCP region; however, users may choose which
  specific zone (or collection of zones for cross-zone instances) an instance
  should be provisioned in. Refer to [location_id] and
  [alternative_location_id] fields for more details. Defaults to `nil`.
  - persistenceIamIdentity (String.t): Output only. Cloud IAM identity used by import / export operations to
  transfer data to/from Cloud Storage. Format is
  "serviceAccount:<service_account_email>". The value may change over time
  for a given instance so should be checked before each import/export
  operation. Defaults to `nil`.
  - port (integer()): Output only. The port number of the exposed Redis endpoint. Defaults to `nil`.
  - redisConfigs (map()): Optional. Redis configuration parameters, according to
  http://redis.io/topics/config. Currently, the only supported parameters
  are:

  Redis 3.2 and above:

  *   maxmemory-policy
  *   notify-keyspace-events

  Redis 4.0 and above:

  *   activedefrag
  *   lfu-log-factor
  *   lfu-decay-time Defaults to `nil`.
  - redisVersion (String.t): Optional. The version of Redis software.
  If not provided, latest supported version will be used. Updating the
  version will perform an upgrade/downgrade to the new version. Currently,
  the supported values are:

  *   `REDIS_4_0` for Redis 4.0 compatibility
  *   `REDIS_3_2` for Redis 3.2 compatibility (default) Defaults to `nil`.
  - reservedIpRange (String.t): Optional. The CIDR range of internal addresses that are reserved for this
  instance. If not provided, the service will choose an unused /29 block,
  for example, 10.0.0.0/29 or 192.168.0.0/29. Ranges must be unique
  and non-overlapping with existing subnets in an authorized network. Defaults to `nil`.
  - state (String.t): Output only. The current state of this instance. Defaults to `nil`.
  - statusMessage (String.t): Output only. Additional information about the current status of this
  instance, if available. Defaults to `nil`.
  - tier (String.t): Required. The service tier of the instance. Defaults to `nil`.
