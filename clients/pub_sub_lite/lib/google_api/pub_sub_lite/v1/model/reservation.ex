  Metadata about a reservation resource.

  ## Attributes

  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The name of the reservation. Structured like: projects/{project_number}/locations/{location}/reservations/{reservation_id}
  *   `throughputCapacity` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The reserved throughput capacity. Every unit of throughput capacity is equivalent to 1 MiB/s of published messages or 2 MiB/s of subscribed messages. Any topics which are declared as using capacity from a Reservation will consume resources from this reservation instead of being charged individually.
