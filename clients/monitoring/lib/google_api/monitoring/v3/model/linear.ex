  Specifies a linear sequence of buckets that all have the same width (except overflow and underflow). Each bucket represents a constant absolute uncertainty on the specific value in the bucket.There are num_finite_buckets + 2 (&#x3D; N) buckets. Bucket i has the following boundaries:Upper bound (0 &lt;&#x3D; i &lt; N-1): offset + (width * i).  Lower bound (1 &lt;&#x3D; i &lt; N): offset + (width * (i - 1)).
