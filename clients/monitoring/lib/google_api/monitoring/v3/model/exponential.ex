defmodule GoogleApi.Monitoring.V3.Model.Exponential do
  @moduledoc """
  Specifies an exponential sequence of buckets that have a width that is proportional to the value of the lower bound. Each bucket represents a constant relative uncertainty on a specific value in the bucket.There are num_finite_buckets + 2 (= N) buckets. Bucket i has the following boundaries:Upper bound (0 <= i < N-1): scale * (growth_factor ^ i).Lower bound (1 <= i < N): scale * (growth_factor ^ (i - 1)).

  ## Attributes

  *   `growthFactor` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Must be greater than 1.
  *   `numFiniteBuckets` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Must be greater than 0.
  *   `scale` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Must be greater than 0.
