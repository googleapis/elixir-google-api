defmodule GoogleApi.Monitoring.V3.Model.ServiceLevelObjective do
  @moduledoc """
  A Service-Level Objective (SLO) describes a level of desired good service. It consists of a service-level indicator (SLI), a performance goal, and a period over which the objective is to be evaluated against that goal. The SLO can use SLIs defined in a number of different manners. Typical SLOs might include "99% of requests in each rolling week have latency below 200 milliseconds" or "99.5% of requests in each calendar month return successfully."

  ## Attributes

  *   `calendarPeriod` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A calendar period, semantically "since the start of the current <calendar_period>". At this time, only DAY, WEEK, FORTNIGHT, and MONTH are supported.
  *   `displayName` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Name used for UI elements listing this SLO.
  *   `goal` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - The fraction of service that must be good in order for this objective to be met. 0 < goal <= 1.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Resource name for this ServiceLevelObjective. Of the form projects/{project_id}/services/{service_id}/serviceLevelObjectives/{slo_name}.
  *   `rollingPeriod` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A rolling time period, semantically "in the past <rolling_period>". Must be an integer multiple of 1 day no larger than 30 days.
  *   `serviceLevelIndicator` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Monitoring.V3.Model.ServiceLevelIndicator.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The definition of good service, used to measure and calculate the quality of the Service's performance with respect to a single aspect of service quality.
