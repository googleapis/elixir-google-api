  Specifies how many time series must fail a predicate to trigger a condition. If not specified, then a {count: 1} trigger is used.

  *   `count` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - The absolute number of time series that must fail the predicate for the condition to be triggered.
  *   `percent` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - The percentage of time series that must fail the predicate for the condition to be triggered.
