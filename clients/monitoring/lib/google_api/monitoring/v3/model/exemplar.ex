  @moduledoc """
  Exemplars are example points that may be used to annotate aggregated distribution values. They are metadata that gives information about a particular value added to a Distribution bucket, such as a trace ID that was active when a value was added. They may contain further information, such as a example values and timestamps, origin, etc.

  ## Attributes

  - attachments ([Object]): Contextual information about the example value. Examples are:Trace ID: type.googleapis.com/google.devtools.cloudtrace.v1.TraceLiteral string: type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.StringValueLabels dropped during aggregation:  type.googleapis.com/google.monitoring.v3.DroppedLabelsThere may be only a single attachment of any given message type in a single exemplar, and this is enforced by the system. Defaults to: `null`.
  - timestamp (DateTime.t): The observation (sampling) time of the above value. Defaults to: `null`.
  - value (float()): Value of the exemplar point. This value determines to which bucket the exemplar belongs. Defaults to: `null`.
