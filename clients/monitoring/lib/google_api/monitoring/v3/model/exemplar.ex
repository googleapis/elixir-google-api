defmodule GoogleApi.Monitoring.V3.Model.Exemplar do
  @moduledoc """
  Exemplars are example points that may be used to annotate aggregated distribution values. They are metadata that gives information about a particular value added to a Distribution bucket, such as a trace ID that was active when a value was added. They may contain further information, such as a example values and timestamps, origin, etc.

  ## Attributes

  *   `attachments` (*type:* `list(map())`, *default:* `nil`) - Contextual information about the example value. Examples are:Trace: type.googleapis.com/google.monitoring.v3.SpanContextLiteral string: type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.StringValueLabels dropped during aggregation: type.googleapis.com/google.monitoring.v3.DroppedLabelsThere may be only a single attachment of any given message type in a single exemplar, and this is enforced by the system.
  *   `timestamp` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The observation (sampling) time of the above value.
  *   `value` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Value of the exemplar point. This value determines to which bucket the exemplar belongs.
