  ## Attributes

  *   `delegates` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The sequence of service accounts in a delegation chain. Each service
      account must be granted the `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` role
      on its next service account in the chain. The last service account in the
      chain must be granted the `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` role
      on the service account that is specified in the `name` field of the
      request.

      The delegates must have the following format:
      `projects/-/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT_EMAIL_OR_UNIQUEID}`. The `-` wildcard
      character is required; replacing it with a project ID is invalid.
  *   `lifetime` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The desired lifetime duration of the access token in seconds.
      Must be set to a value less than or equal to 3600 (1 hour). If a value is
      not specified, the token's lifetime will be set to a default value of one
      hour.
  *   `scope` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Code to identify the scopes to be included in the OAuth 2.0 access token.
      See https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes for more
      information.
      At least one value required.
