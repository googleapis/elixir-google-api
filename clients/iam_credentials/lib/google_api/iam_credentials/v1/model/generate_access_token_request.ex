  ## Attributes

  - delegates ([String.t]): The sequence of service accounts in a delegation chain. Each service account must be granted the &#x60;roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator&#x60; role on its next service account in the chain. The last service account in the chain must be granted the &#x60;roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator&#x60; role on the service account that is specified in the &#x60;name&#x60; field of the request.  The delegates must have the following format: &#x60;projects/-/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT_EMAIL_OR_UNIQUEID}&#x60;. The &#x60;-&#x60; wildcard character is required; replacing it with a project ID is invalid. Defaults to: `null`.
  - lifetime (String.t): The desired lifetime duration of the access token in seconds. Must be set to a value less than or equal to 3600 (1 hour). If a value is not specified, the token&#39;s lifetime will be set to a default value of one hour. Defaults to: `null`.
  - scope ([String.t]): Code to identify the scopes to be included in the OAuth 2.0 access token. See https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes for more information. At least one value required. Defaults to: `null`.
