  ## Attributes

  *   `delegates` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The sequence of service accounts in a delegation chain. This field is required for [delegated requests](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/credentials/delegated-request). For [direct requests](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/credentials/direct-request), which are more common, do not specify this field. Each service account must be granted the `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` role on its next service account in the chain. The last service account in the chain must be granted the `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` role on the service account that is specified in the `name` field of the request. The delegates must have the following format: `projects/-/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT_EMAIL_OR_UNIQUEID}`. The `-` wildcard character is required; replacing it with a project ID is invalid.
  *   `lifetime` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The desired lifetime duration of the access token in seconds. By default, the maximum allowed value is 1 hour. To set a lifetime of up to 12 hours, you can add the service account as an allowed value in an Organization Policy that enforces the `constraints/iam.allowServiceAccountCredentialLifetimeExtension` constraint. See detailed instructions at https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/credentials/lifetime If a value is not specified, the token's lifetime will be set to a default value of 1 hour.
  *   `scope` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. Code to identify the scopes to be included in the OAuth 2.0 access token. See https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes for more information. At least one value required.
