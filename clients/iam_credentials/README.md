# GoogleApi.IAMCredentials

IAM Service Account Credentials API client library.

Creates short-lived credentials for impersonating IAM service accounts. Disabling this API also disables the IAM API (iam.googleapis.com). However, enabling this API doesn't enable the IAM API. 

## Installation

Install this package from [Hex](https://hex.pm) by adding
`google_api_iam_credentials` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:
