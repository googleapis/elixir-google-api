defmodule GoogleApi.Dialogflow.V2.Model.GoogleCloudDialogflowCxV3beta1ResponseMessageConversationSuccess do
  @moduledoc """
  Indicates that the conversation succeeded, i.e., the bot handled the issue
  that the customer talked to it about.

  Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be
  counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in
  any way. Note that Dialogflow also considers conversations that get to the
  conversation end page as successful even if they don't return
  ConversationSuccess.

  You may set this, for example:
  * In the entry_fulfillment of a Page if
    entering the page indicates that the conversation succeeded.
  * In a webhook response when you determine that you handled the customer
    issue.

  ## Attributes

  *   `metadata` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - Custom metadata. Dialogflow doesn't impose any structure on this.
