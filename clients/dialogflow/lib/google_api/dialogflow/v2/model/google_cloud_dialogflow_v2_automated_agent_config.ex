  ## Attributes

  *   `agent` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. ID of the Dialogflow agent environment to use. This project needs to either be the same project as the conversation or you need to grant `service-@gcp-sa-dialogflow.iam.gserviceaccount.com` the `Dialogflow API Service Agent` role in this project. - For ES agents, use format: `projects//locations//agent/environments/`. If environment is not specified, the default `draft` environment is used. Refer to [DetectIntentRequest](/dialogflow/docs/reference/rpc/google.cloud.dialogflow.v2#google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.DetectIntentRequest) for more details. - For CX agents, use format `projects//locations//agents//environments/`. If environment is not specified, the default `draft` environment is used.
