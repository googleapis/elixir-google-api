defmodule GoogleApi.Dialogflow.V2.Model.GoogleCloudDialogflowV2beta1KnowledgeAnswersAnswer do
  @moduledoc """
  An answer from Knowledge Connector.

  ## Attributes

  *   `answer` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The piece of text from the `source` knowledge base document that answers
      this conversational query.
  *   `faqQuestion` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The corresponding FAQ question if the answer was extracted from a FAQ
      Document, empty otherwise.
  *   `matchConfidence` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - The system's confidence score that this Knowledge answer is a good match
      for this conversational query.
      The range is from 0.0 (completely uncertain) to 1.0 (completely certain).
      Note: The confidence score is likely to vary somewhat (possibly even for
      identical requests), as the underlying model is under constant
      improvement. It may be deprecated in the future. We recommend using
      `match_confidence_level` which should be generally more stable.
  *   `matchConfidenceLevel` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The system's confidence level that this knowledge answer is a good match
      for this conversational query.
      NOTE: The confidence level for a given `<query, answer>` pair may change
      without notice, as it depends on models that are constantly being
      improved. However, it will change less frequently than the confidence
      score below, and should be preferred for referencing the quality of an
      answer.
  *   `source` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Indicates which Knowledge Document this answer was extracted from.
      Format: `projects/<Project ID>/knowledgeBases/<Knowledge Base
      ID>/documents/<Document ID>`.
