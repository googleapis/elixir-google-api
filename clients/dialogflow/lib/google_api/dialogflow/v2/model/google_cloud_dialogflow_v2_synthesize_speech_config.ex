defmodule GoogleApi.Dialogflow.V2.Model.GoogleCloudDialogflowV2SynthesizeSpeechConfig do
  @moduledoc """
  Configuration of how speech should be synthesized.

  ## Attributes

  - effectsProfileId (list(String.t)): Optional. An identifier which selects 'audio effects' profiles that are
  applied on (post synthesized) text to speech. Effects are applied on top of
  each other in the order they are given. Defaults to `nil`.
  - pitch (float()): Optional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20
  semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the
  original pitch. Defaults to `nil`.
  - speakingRate (float()): Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal
  native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and
  0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any
  other values < 0.25 or > 4.0 will return an error. Defaults to `nil`.
  - voice (GoogleApi.Dialogflow.V2.Model.GoogleCloudDialogflowV2VoiceSelectionParams.t): Optional. The desired voice of the synthesized audio. Defaults to `nil`.
  - volumeGainDb (float()): Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the
  specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of
  0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB)
  will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal
  amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the
  amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not
  to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for
  any value greater than that. Defaults to `nil`.
