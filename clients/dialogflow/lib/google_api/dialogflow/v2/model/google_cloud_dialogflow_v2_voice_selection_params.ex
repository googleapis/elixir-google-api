  Description of which voice to use for speech synthesis.

  ## Attributes

  - name (String.t): Optional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a
  voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and gender. Defaults to `nil`.
  - ssmlGender (String.t): Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will
  choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and
  name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a
  voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should
  substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request. Defaults to `nil`.
