defmodule GoogleApi.Dialogflow.V3.Model.GoogleCloudDialogflowV2SpeechWordInfo do
  @moduledoc """
  Information for a word recognized by the speech recognizer.

  ## Attributes

  *   `confidence` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - The Speech confidence between 0.0 and 1.0 for this word. A higher number indicates an estimated greater likelihood that the recognized word is correct. The default of 0.0 is a sentinel value indicating that confidence was not set. This field is not guaranteed to be fully stable over time for the same audio input. Users should also not rely on it to always be provided.
  *   `endOffset` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Time offset relative to the beginning of the audio that corresponds to the end of the spoken word. This is an experimental feature and the accuracy of the time offset can vary.
  *   `startOffset` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Time offset relative to the beginning of the audio that corresponds to the start of the spoken word. This is an experimental feature and the accuracy of the time offset can vary.
  *   `word` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The word this info is for.
