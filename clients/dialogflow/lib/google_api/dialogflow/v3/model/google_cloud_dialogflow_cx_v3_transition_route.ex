defmodule GoogleApi.Dialogflow.V3.Model.GoogleCloudDialogflowCxV3TransitionRoute do
  @moduledoc """
  A transition route specifies a intent that can be matched and/or a data condition that can be evaluated during a session. When a specified transition is matched, the following actions are taken in order: * If there is a `trigger_fulfillment` associated with the transition, it will be called. * If there is a `target_page` associated with the transition, the session will transition into the specified page. * If there is a `target_flow` associated with the transition, the session will transition into the specified flow.

  ## Attributes

  *   `condition` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The condition to evaluate against form parameters or session parameters. See the [conditions reference](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/condition). At least one of `intent` or `condition` must be specified. When both `intent` and `condition` are specified, the transition can only happen when both are fulfilled.
  *   `description` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. The description of the transition route. The maximum length is 500 characters.
  *   `intent` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The unique identifier of an Intent. Format: `projects//locations//agents//intents/`. Indicates that the transition can only happen when the given intent is matched. At least one of `intent` or `condition` must be specified. When both `intent` and `condition` are specified, the transition can only happen when both are fulfilled.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The unique identifier of this transition route.
  *   `targetFlow` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The target flow to transition to. Format: `projects//locations//agents//flows/`.
  *   `targetPage` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The target page to transition to. Format: `projects//locations//agents//flows//pages/`.
  *   `triggerFulfillment` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Dialogflow.V3.Model.GoogleCloudDialogflowCxV3Fulfillment.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The fulfillment to call when the condition is satisfied. At least one of `trigger_fulfillment` and `target` must be specified. When both are defined, `trigger_fulfillment` is executed first.
