defmodule GoogleApi.Classroom.V1.Model.CourseAlias do
  @moduledoc """
  Alternative identifier for a course.

  An alias uniquely identifies a course. It must be unique within one of the
  following scopes:

  * domain: A domain-scoped alias is visible to all users within the alias
  creator's domain and can be created only by a domain admin. A domain-scoped
  alias is often used when a course has an identifier external to Classroom.

  * project: A project-scoped alias is visible to any request from an
  application using the Developer Console project ID that created the alias
  and can be created by any project. A project-scoped alias is often used when
  an application has alternative identifiers. A random value can also be used
  to avoid duplicate courses in the event of transmission failures, as retrying
  a request will return `ALREADY_EXISTS` if a previous one has succeeded.

  ## Attributes

  - alias (String.t): Alias string. The format of the string indicates the desired alias scoping.

  * `d:<name>` indicates a domain-scoped alias.
  Example: `d:math_101`
  * `p:<name>` indicates a project-scoped alias.
  Example: `p:abc123`

  This field has a maximum length of 256 characters. Defaults to `nil`.
