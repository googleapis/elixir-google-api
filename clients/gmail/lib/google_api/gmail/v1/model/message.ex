defmodule GoogleApi.Gmail.V1.Model.Message do
  @moduledoc """
  An email message.

  ## Attributes

  - historyId (String.t): The ID of the last history record that modified this message. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String.t): The immutable ID of the message. Defaults to: `null`.
  - internalDate (String.t): The internal message creation timestamp (epoch ms), which determines ordering in the inbox. For normal SMTP-received email, this represents the time the message was originally accepted by Google, which is more reliable than the Date header. However, for API-migrated mail, it can be configured by client to be based on the Date header. Defaults to: `null`.
  - labelIds ([String.t]): List of IDs of labels applied to this message. Defaults to: `null`.
  - payload (MessagePart): The parsed email structure in the message parts. Defaults to: `null`.
  - raw (binary()): The entire email message in an RFC 2822 formatted and base64url encoded string. Returned in messages.get and drafts.get responses when the format&#x3D;RAW parameter is supplied. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sizeEstimate (integer()): Estimated size in bytes of the message. Defaults to: `null`.
  - snippet (String.t): A short part of the message text. Defaults to: `null`.
  - threadId (String.t): The ID of the thread the message belongs to. To add a message or draft to a thread, the following criteria must be met:  - The requested threadId must be specified on the Message or Draft.Message you supply with your request.  - The References and In-Reply-To headers must be set in compliance with the RFC 2822 standard.  - The Subject headers must match. Defaults to: `null`.
