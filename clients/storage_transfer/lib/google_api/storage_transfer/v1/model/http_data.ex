defmodule GoogleApi.StorageTransfer.V1.Model.HttpData do
  @moduledoc """
  An HttpData resource specifies a list of objects on the web to be transferred
  over HTTP.  The information of the objects to be transferred is contained in
  a file referenced by a URL. The first line in the file must be
  "TsvHttpData-1.0", which specifies the format of the file.  Subsequent lines
  specify the information of the list of objects, one object per list entry.
  Each entry has the following tab-delimited fields:

  * HTTP URL - The location of the object.

  * Length - The size of the object in bytes.

  * MD5 - The base64-encoded MD5 hash of the object.

  For an example of a valid TSV file, see
  [Transferring data from
  URLs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/transfer/create-url-list).

  When transferring data based on a URL list, keep the following in mind:

  * When an object located at `http(s)://hostname:port/<URL-path>` is
  transferred to a data sink, the name of the object at the data sink is
  `<hostname>/<URL-path>`.

  * If the specified size of an object does not match the actual size of the
  object fetched, the object will not be transferred.

  * If the specified MD5 does not match the MD5 computed from the transferred
  bytes, the object transfer will fail. For more information, see
  [Generating MD5 hashes](https://cloud.google.com/storage/transfer/#md5)

  * Ensure that each URL you specify is publicly accessible. For
  example, in Google Cloud Storage you can
  [share an object publicly]
  (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/cloud-console#_sharingdata) and get
  a link to it.

  * Storage Transfer Service obeys `robots.txt` rules and requires the source
  HTTP server to support `Range` requests and to return a `Content-Length`
  header in each response.

  * [ObjectConditions](#ObjectConditions) have no effect when filtering objects
  to transfer.

  ## Attributes

  - listUrl (String.t): Required. The URL that points to the file that stores the object list
  entries. This file must allow public access.  Currently, only URLs with
  HTTP and HTTPS schemes are supported. Defaults to `nil`.
