defmodule GoogleApi.StorageTransfer.V1.Model.TransferOptions do
  @moduledoc """
  TransferOptions uses three boolean parameters to define the actions
  to be performed on objects in a transfer.

  ## Attributes

  - deleteObjectsFromSourceAfterTransfer (boolean()): Whether objects should be deleted from the source after they are
  transferred to the sink.  Note that this option and
  `deleteObjectsUniqueInSink` are mutually exclusive. Defaults to `nil`.
  - deleteObjectsUniqueInSink (boolean()): Whether objects that exist only in the sink should be deleted.  Note that
  this option and `deleteObjectsFromSourceAfterTransfer` are mutually
  exclusive. Defaults to `nil`.
  - overwriteObjectsAlreadyExistingInSink (boolean()): Whether overwriting objects that already exist in the sink is allowed. Defaults to `nil`.
