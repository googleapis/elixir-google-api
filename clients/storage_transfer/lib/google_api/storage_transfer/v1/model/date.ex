defmodule GoogleApi.StorageTransfer.V1.Model.Date do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents a whole or partial calendar date, e.g. a birthday. The time of day
  and time zone are either specified elsewhere or are not significant. The date
  is relative to the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar. This can represent:

  * A full date, with non-zero year, month and day values
  * A month and day value, with a zero year, e.g. an anniversary
  * A year on its own, with zero month and day values
  * A year and month value, with a zero day, e.g. a credit card expiration date

  Related types are google.type.TimeOfDay and `google.protobuf.Timestamp`.

  ## Attributes

  - day (integer()): Day of month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0
  if specifying a year by itself or a year and month where the day is not
  significant. Defaults to `nil`.
  - month (integer()): Month of year. Must be from 1 to 12, or 0 if specifying a year without a
  month and day. Defaults to `nil`.
  - year (integer()): Year of date. Must be from 1 to 9999, or 0 if specifying a date without
  a year. Defaults to `nil`.
