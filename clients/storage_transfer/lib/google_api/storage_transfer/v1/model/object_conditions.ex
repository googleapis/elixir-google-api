defmodule GoogleApi.StorageTransfer.V1.Model.ObjectConditions do
  @moduledoc """
  Conditions that determine which objects will be transferred. Applies only to Cloud Data Sources such as S3, Azure, and Cloud Storage. The "last modification time" refers to the time of the last change to the object's content or metadata — specifically, this is the `updated` property of Cloud Storage objects, the `LastModified` field of S3 objects, and the `Last-Modified` header of Azure blobs.

  ## Attributes

  *   `excludePrefixes` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - If you specify `exclude_prefixes`, Storage Transfer Service uses the items in the `exclude_prefixes` array to determine which objects to exclude from a transfer. Objects must not start with one of the matching `exclude_prefixes` for inclusion in a transfer. The following are requirements of `exclude_prefixes`: * Each exclude-prefix can contain any sequence of Unicode characters, to a max length of 1024 bytes when UTF8-encoded, and must not contain Carriage Return or Line Feed characters. Wildcard matching and regular expression matching are not supported. * Each exclude-prefix must omit the leading slash. For example, to exclude the object `s3://my-aws-bucket/logs/y=2015/requests.gz`, specify the exclude-prefix as `logs/y=2015/requests.gz`. * None of the exclude-prefix values can be empty, if specified. * Each exclude-prefix must exclude a distinct portion of the object namespace. No exclude-prefix may be a prefix of another exclude-prefix. * If include_prefixes is specified, then each exclude-prefix must start with the value of a path explicitly included by `include_prefixes`. The max size of `exclude_prefixes` is 1000. For more information, see [Filtering objects from transfers](/storage-transfer/docs/filtering-objects-from-transfers).
  *   `includePrefixes` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - If you specify `include_prefixes`, Storage Transfer Service uses the items in the `include_prefixes` array to determine which objects to include in a transfer. Objects must start with one of the matching `include_prefixes` for inclusion in the transfer. If exclude_prefixes is specified, objects must not start with any of the `exclude_prefixes` specified for inclusion in the transfer. The following are requirements of `include_prefixes`: * Each include-prefix can contain any sequence of Unicode characters, to a max length of 1024 bytes when UTF8-encoded, and must not contain Carriage Return or Line Feed characters. Wildcard matching and regular expression matching are not supported. * Each include-prefix must omit the leading slash. For example, to include the object `s3://my-aws-bucket/logs/y=2015/requests.gz`, specify the include-prefix as `logs/y=2015/requests.gz`. * None of the include-prefix values can be empty, if specified. * Each include-prefix must include a distinct portion of the object namespace. No include-prefix may be a prefix of another include-prefix. The max size of `include_prefixes` is 1000. For more information, see [Filtering objects from transfers](/storage-transfer/docs/filtering-objects-from-transfers).
  *   `lastModifiedBefore` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - If specified, only objects with a "last modification time" before this timestamp and objects that don't have a "last modification time" will be transferred.
  *   `lastModifiedSince` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - If specified, only objects with a "last modification time" on or after this timestamp and objects that don't have a "last modification time" are transferred. The `last_modified_since` and `last_modified_before` fields can be used together for chunked data processing. For example, consider a script that processes each day's worth of data at a time. For that you'd set each of the fields as follows: * `last_modified_since` to the start of the day * `last_modified_before` to the end of the day
  *   `maxTimeElapsedSinceLastModification` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - If specified, only objects with a "last modification time" on or after `NOW` - `max_time_elapsed_since_last_modification` and objects that don't have a "last modification time" are transferred. For each TransferOperation started by this TransferJob, `NOW` refers to the start_time of the `TransferOperation`.
  *   `minTimeElapsedSinceLastModification` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - If specified, only objects with a "last modification time" before `NOW` - `min_time_elapsed_since_last_modification` and objects that don't have a "last modification time" are transferred. For each TransferOperation started by this TransferJob, `NOW` refers to the start_time of the `TransferOperation`.
