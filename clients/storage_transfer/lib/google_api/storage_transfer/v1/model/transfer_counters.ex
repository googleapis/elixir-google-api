  ## Attributes

  *   `bytesCopiedToSink` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Bytes that are copied to the data sink.
  *   `bytesDeletedFromSink` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Bytes that are deleted from the data sink.
  *   `bytesDeletedFromSource` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Bytes that are deleted from the data source.
  *   `bytesFailedToDeleteFromSink` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Bytes that failed to be deleted from the data sink.
  *   `bytesFoundFromSource` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Bytes found in the data source that are scheduled to be transferred,
      excluding any that are filtered based on object conditions or skipped due
      to sync.
  *   `bytesFoundOnlyFromSink` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Bytes found only in the data sink that are scheduled to be deleted.
  *   `bytesFromSourceFailed` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Bytes in the data source that failed to be transferred or that failed to
      be deleted after being transferred.
  *   `bytesFromSourceSkippedBySync` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Bytes in the data source that are not transferred because they already
      exist in the data sink.
  *   `objectsCopiedToSink` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Objects that are copied to the data sink.
  *   `objectsDeletedFromSink` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Objects that are deleted from the data sink.
  *   `objectsDeletedFromSource` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Objects that are deleted from the data source.
  *   `objectsFailedToDeleteFromSink` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Objects that failed to be deleted from the data sink.
  *   `objectsFoundFromSource` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Objects found in the data source that are scheduled to be transferred,
      excluding any that are filtered based on object conditions or skipped due
      to sync.
  *   `objectsFoundOnlyFromSink` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Objects found only in the data sink that are scheduled to be deleted.
  *   `objectsFromSourceFailed` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Objects in the data source that failed to be transferred or that failed
      to be deleted after being transferred.
  *   `objectsFromSourceSkippedBySync` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Objects in the data source that are not transferred because they already
      exist in the data sink.
