defmodule GoogleApi.StorageTransfer.V1.Model.TransferCounters do
  @moduledoc """
  A collection of counters that report the progress of a transfer operation.

  ## Attributes

  *   `bytesCopiedToSink` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Bytes that are copied to the data sink.
  *   `bytesDeletedFromSink` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Bytes that are deleted from the data sink.
  *   `bytesDeletedFromSource` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Bytes that are deleted from the data source.
  *   `bytesFailedToDeleteFromSink` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Bytes that failed to be deleted from the data sink.
  *   `bytesFoundFromSource` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Bytes found in the data source that are scheduled to be transferred, excluding any that are filtered based on object conditions or skipped due to sync.
  *   `bytesFoundOnlyFromSink` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Bytes found only in the data sink that are scheduled to be deleted.
  *   `bytesFromSourceFailed` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Bytes in the data source that failed to be transferred or that failed to be deleted after being transferred.
  *   `bytesFromSourceSkippedBySync` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Bytes in the data source that are not transferred because they already exist in the data sink.
  *   `directoriesFailedToListFromSource` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - For transfers involving PosixFilesystem only. Number of listing failures for each directory found at the source. Potential failures when listing a directory include permission failure or block failure. If listing a directory fails, no files in the directory are transferred.
  *   `directoriesFoundFromSource` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - For transfers involving PosixFilesystem only. Number of directories found while listing. For example, if the root directory of the transfer is `base/` and there are two other directories, `a/` and `b/` under this directory, the count after listing `base/`, `base/a/` and `base/b/` is 3.
  *   `directoriesSuccessfullyListedFromSource` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - For transfers involving PosixFilesystem only. Number of successful listings for each directory found at the source.
  *   `objectsCopiedToSink` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Objects that are copied to the data sink.
  *   `objectsDeletedFromSink` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Objects that are deleted from the data sink.
  *   `objectsDeletedFromSource` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Objects that are deleted from the data source.
  *   `objectsFailedToDeleteFromSink` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Objects that failed to be deleted from the data sink.
  *   `objectsFoundFromSource` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Objects found in the data source that are scheduled to be transferred, excluding any that are filtered based on object conditions or skipped due to sync.
  *   `objectsFoundOnlyFromSink` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Objects found only in the data sink that are scheduled to be deleted.
  *   `objectsFromSourceFailed` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Objects in the data source that failed to be transferred or that failed to be deleted after being transferred.
  *   `objectsFromSourceSkippedBySync` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Objects in the data source that are not transferred because they already exist in the data sink.
