  Sequence conditions consist of one or more steps, where each step is defined by one or more dimension/metric conditions. Multiple steps can be combined with special sequence operators.

  ## Attributes

  - firstStepShouldMatchFirstHit (boolean()): If set, first step condition must match the first hit of the visitor (in the date range). Defaults to: `null`.
  - segmentSequenceSteps ([SegmentSequenceStep]): The list of steps in the sequence. Defaults to: `null`.
