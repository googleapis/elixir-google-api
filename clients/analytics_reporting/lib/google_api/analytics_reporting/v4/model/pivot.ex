defmodule GoogleApi.AnalyticsReporting.V4.Model.Pivot do
  @moduledoc """
  The Pivot describes the pivot section in the request.
  The Pivot helps rearrange the information in the table for certain reports
  by pivoting your data on a second dimension.

  ## Attributes

  - dimensionFilterClauses (list(GoogleApi.AnalyticsReporting.V4.Model.DimensionFilterClause.t)): DimensionFilterClauses are logically combined with an `AND` operator: only
  data that is included by all these DimensionFilterClauses contributes to
  the values in this pivot region. Dimension filters can be used to restrict
  the columns shown in the pivot region. For example if you have
  `ga:browser` as the requested dimension in the pivot region, and you
  specify key filters to restrict `ga:browser` to only "IE" or "Firefox",
  then only those two browsers would show up as columns. Defaults to `nil`.
  - dimensions (list(GoogleApi.AnalyticsReporting.V4.Model.Dimension.t)): A list of dimensions to show as pivot columns. A Pivot can have a maximum
  of 4 dimensions. Pivot dimensions are part of the restriction on the
  total number of dimensions allowed in the request. Defaults to `nil`.
  - maxGroupCount (integer()): Specifies the maximum number of groups to return.
  The default value is 10, also the maximum value is 1,000. Defaults to `nil`.
  - metrics (list(GoogleApi.AnalyticsReporting.V4.Model.Metric.t)): The pivot metrics. Pivot metrics are part of the
  restriction on total number of metrics allowed in the request. Defaults to `nil`.
  - startGroup (integer()): If k metrics were requested, then the response will contain some
  data-dependent multiple of k columns in the report.  E.g., if you pivoted
  on the dimension `ga:browser` then you'd get k columns for "Firefox", k
  columns for "IE", k columns for "Chrome", etc. The ordering of the groups
  of columns is determined by descending order of "total" for the first of
  the k values.  Ties are broken by lexicographic ordering of the first
  pivot dimension, then lexicographic ordering of the second pivot
  dimension, and so on.  E.g., if the totals for the first value for
  Firefox, IE, and Chrome were 8, 2, 8, respectively, the order of columns
  would be Chrome, Firefox, IE.

  The following let you choose which of the groups of k columns are
  included in the response. Defaults to `nil`.
