defmodule GoogleApi.AnalyticsReporting.V4.Model.Activity do
  @moduledoc """
  An Activity represents data for an activity of a user. Note that an
  Activity is different from a hit.
  A hit might result in multiple Activity's. For example, if a hit
  includes a transaction and a goal completion, there will be two
  Activity protos for this hit, one for ECOMMERCE and one for GOAL.
  Conversely, multiple hits can also construct one Activity. In classic
  e-commerce, data for one transaction might be sent through multiple hits.
  These hits will be merged into one ECOMMERCE Activity.

  ## Attributes

  - activityTime (DateTime.t): Timestamp of the activity. Defaults to `nil`.
  - activityType (String.t): Type of this activity. Defaults to `nil`.
  - appview (GoogleApi.AnalyticsReporting.V4.Model.ScreenviewData.t): This will be set if `activity_type` equals `SCREEN_VIEW`. Defaults to `nil`.
  - campaign (String.t): For manual campaign tracking, it is the value of the utm_campaign campaign
  tracking parameter. For AdWords autotagging, it is the name(s) of the
  online ad campaign(s) you use for the property. If you use neither, its
  value is (not set). Defaults to `nil`.
  - channelGrouping (String.t): The Channel Group associated with an end user's session for this View
  (defined by the View's Channel Groupings). Defaults to `nil`.
  - customDimension (list(GoogleApi.AnalyticsReporting.V4.Model.CustomDimension.t)): A list of all custom dimensions associated with this activity. Defaults to `nil`.
  - ecommerce (GoogleApi.AnalyticsReporting.V4.Model.EcommerceData.t): This will be set if `activity_type` equals `ECOMMERCE`. Defaults to `nil`.
  - event (GoogleApi.AnalyticsReporting.V4.Model.EventData.t): This field contains all the details pertaining to an event and will be
  set if `activity_type` equals `EVENT`. Defaults to `nil`.
  - goals (GoogleApi.AnalyticsReporting.V4.Model.GoalSetData.t): This field contains a list of all the goals that were reached in this
  activity when `activity_type` equals `GOAL`. Defaults to `nil`.
  - hostname (String.t): The hostname from which the tracking request was made. Defaults to `nil`.
  - keyword (String.t): For manual campaign tracking, it is the value of the utm_term campaign
  tracking parameter. For AdWords traffic, it contains the best matching
  targeting criteria. For the display network, where multiple targeting
  criteria could have caused the ad to show up, it returns the best matching
  targeting criteria as selected by Ads. This could be display_keyword, site
  placement, boomuserlist, user_interest, age, or gender. Otherwise its value
  is (not set). Defaults to `nil`.
  - landingPagePath (String.t): The first page in users' sessions, or the landing page. Defaults to `nil`.
  - medium (String.t): The type of referrals. For manual campaign tracking, it is the value of the
  utm_medium campaign tracking parameter. For AdWords autotagging, it is cpc.
  If users came from a search engine detected by Google Analytics, it is
  organic. If the referrer is not a search engine, it is referral. If users
  came directly to the property and document.referrer is empty, its value is
  (none). Defaults to `nil`.
  - pageview (GoogleApi.AnalyticsReporting.V4.Model.PageviewData.t): This will be set if `activity_type` equals `PAGEVIEW`. This field
  contains all the details about the visitor and the page that was visited. Defaults to `nil`.
  - source (String.t): The source of referrals. For manual campaign tracking, it is the value of
  the utm_source campaign tracking parameter. For AdWords autotagging, it is
  google. If you use neither, it is the domain of the source
  (e.g., document.referrer) referring the users. It may also contain a port
  address. If users arrived without a referrer, its value is (direct). Defaults to `nil`.
