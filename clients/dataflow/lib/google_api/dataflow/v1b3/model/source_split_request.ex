defmodule GoogleApi.Dataflow.V1b3.Model.SourceSplitRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents the operation to split a high-level Source specification
  into bundles (parts for parallel processing).

  At a high level, splitting of a source into bundles happens as follows:
  SourceSplitRequest is applied to the source. If it returns
  SOURCE_SPLIT_OUTCOME_USE_CURRENT, no further splitting happens and the source
  is used "as is". Otherwise, splitting is applied recursively to each
  produced DerivedSource.

  As an optimization, for any Source, if its does_not_need_splitting is
  true, the framework assumes that splitting this source would return
  SOURCE_SPLIT_OUTCOME_USE_CURRENT, and doesn't initiate a SourceSplitRequest.
  This applies both to the initial source being split and to bundles
  produced from it.

  ## Attributes

  *   `options` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Dataflow.V1b3.Model.SourceSplitOptions.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Hints for tuning the splitting process.
  *   `source` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Dataflow.V1b3.Model.Source.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Specification of the source to be split.
