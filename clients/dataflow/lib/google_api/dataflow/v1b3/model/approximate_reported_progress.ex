defmodule GoogleApi.Dataflow.V1b3.Model.ApproximateReportedProgress do
  @moduledoc """
  A progress measurement of a WorkItem by a worker.

  ## Attributes

  *   `consumedParallelism` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Dataflow.V1b3.Model.ReportedParallelism.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Total amount of parallelism in the portion of input of this task that has
      already been consumed and is no longer active. In the first two examples
      above (see remaining_parallelism), the value should be 29 or 2
      respectively.  The sum of remaining_parallelism and consumed_parallelism
      should equal the total amount of parallelism in this work item.  If
      specified, must be finite.
  *   `fractionConsumed` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Completion as fraction of the input consumed, from 0.0 (beginning, nothing
      consumed), to 1.0 (end of the input, entire input consumed).
  *   `position` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Dataflow.V1b3.Model.Position.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A Position within the work to represent a progress.
  *   `remainingParallelism` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Dataflow.V1b3.Model.ReportedParallelism.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Total amount of parallelism in the input of this task that remains,
      (i.e. can be delegated to this task and any new tasks via dynamic
      splitting). Always at least 1 for non-finished work items and 0 for
      finished.

      "Amount of parallelism" refers to how many non-empty parts of the input
      can be read in parallel. This does not necessarily equal number
      of records. An input that can be read in parallel down to the
      individual records is called "perfectly splittable".
      An example of non-perfectly parallelizable input is a block-compressed
      file format where a block of records has to be read as a whole,
      but different blocks can be read in parallel.

      Examples:
      * If we are processing record #30 (starting at 1) out of 50 in a perfectly
        splittable 50-record input, this value should be 21 (20 remaining + 1
        current).
      * If we are reading through block 3 in a block-compressed file consisting
        of 5 blocks, this value should be 3 (since blocks 4 and 5 can be
        processed in parallel by new tasks via dynamic splitting and the current
        task remains processing block 3).
      * If we are reading through the last block in a block-compressed file,
        or reading or processing the last record in a perfectly splittable
        input, this value should be 1, because apart from the current task, no
        additional remainder can be split off.
