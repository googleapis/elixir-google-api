defmodule GoogleApi.Dataflow.V1b3.Model.SourceSplitResponse do
  @moduledoc """
  The response to a SourceSplitRequest.

  ## Attributes

  - bundles (list(GoogleApi.Dataflow.V1b3.Model.DerivedSource.t)): If outcome is SPLITTING_HAPPENED, then this is a list of bundles
  into which the source was split. Otherwise this field is ignored.
  This list can be empty, which means the source represents an empty input. Defaults to `nil`.
  - outcome (String.t): Indicates whether splitting happened and produced a list of bundles.
  If this is USE_CURRENT_SOURCE_AS_IS, the current source should
  be processed "as is" without splitting. "bundles" is ignored in this case.
  If this is SPLITTING_HAPPENED, then "bundles" contains a list of
  bundles into which the source was split. Defaults to `nil`.
  - shards (list(GoogleApi.Dataflow.V1b3.Model.SourceSplitShard.t)): DEPRECATED in favor of bundles. Defaults to `nil`.
