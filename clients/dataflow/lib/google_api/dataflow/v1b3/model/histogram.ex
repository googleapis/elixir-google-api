defmodule GoogleApi.Dataflow.V1b3.Model.Histogram do
  @moduledoc """
  Histogram of value counts for a distribution.  Buckets have an inclusive lower bound and exclusive upper bound and use \&quot;1,2,5 bucketing\&quot;: The first bucket range is from [0,1) and all subsequent bucket boundaries are powers of ten multiplied by 1, 2, or 5. Thus, bucket boundaries are 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, ... Negative values are not supported.

  ## Attributes

  - bucketCounts ([String.t]): Counts of values in each bucket. For efficiency, prefix and trailing buckets with count &#x3D; 0 are elided. Buckets can store the full range of values of an unsigned long, with ULLONG_MAX falling into the 59th bucket with range [1e19, 2e19). Defaults to: `null`.
  - firstBucketOffset (integer()): Starting index of first stored bucket. The non-inclusive upper-bound of the ith bucket is given by:   pow(10,(i-first_bucket_offset)/3) * (1,2,5)[(i-first_bucket_offset)%3] Defaults to: `null`.
