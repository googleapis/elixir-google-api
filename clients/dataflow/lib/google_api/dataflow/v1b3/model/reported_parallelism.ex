defmodule GoogleApi.Dataflow.V1b3.Model.ReportedParallelism do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents the level of parallelism in a WorkItem&#39;s input, reported by the worker.

  ## Attributes

  - isInfinite (boolean()): Specifies whether the parallelism is infinite. If true, \&quot;value\&quot; is ignored. Infinite parallelism means the service will assume that the work item can always be split into more non-empty work items by dynamic splitting. This is a work-around for lack of support for infinity by the current JSON-based Java RPC stack. Defaults to: `null`.
  - value (float()): Specifies the level of parallelism in case it is finite. Defaults to: `null`.
