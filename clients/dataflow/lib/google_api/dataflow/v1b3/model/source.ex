defmodule GoogleApi.Dataflow.V1b3.Model.Source do
  @moduledoc """
  A source that records can be read and decoded from.

  ## Attributes

  *   `baseSpecs` (*type:* `list(map())`, *default:* `nil`) - While splitting, sources may specify the produced bundles
      as differences against another source, in order to save backend-side
      memory and allow bigger jobs. For details, see SourceSplitRequest.
      To support this use case, the full set of parameters of the source
      is logically obtained by taking the latest explicitly specified value
      of each parameter in the order:
      base_specs (later items win), spec (overrides anything in base_specs).
  *   `codec` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - The codec to use to decode data read from the source.
  *   `doesNotNeedSplitting` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Setting this value to true hints to the framework that the source
      doesn't need splitting, and using SourceSplitRequest on it would
      yield SOURCE_SPLIT_OUTCOME_USE_CURRENT.

      E.g. a file splitter may set this to true when splitting a single file
      into a set of byte ranges of appropriate size, and set this
      to false when splitting a filepattern into individual files.
      However, for efficiency, a file splitter may decide to produce
      file subranges directly from the filepattern to avoid a splitting
      round-trip.

      See SourceSplitRequest for an overview of the splitting process.

      This field is meaningful only in the Source objects populated
      by the user (e.g. when filling in a DerivedSource).
      Source objects supplied by the framework to the user don't have
      this field populated.
  *   `metadata` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Dataflow.V1b3.Model.SourceMetadata.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optionally, metadata for this source can be supplied right away,
      avoiding a SourceGetMetadataOperation roundtrip
      (see SourceOperationRequest).

  *   `spec` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - The source to read from, plus its parameters.
