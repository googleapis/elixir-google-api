  @moduledoc """
  Api is a light-weight descriptor for an API Interface.  Interfaces are also described as \&quot;protocol buffer services\&quot; in some contexts, such as by the \&quot;service\&quot; keyword in a .proto file, but they are different from API Services, which represent a concrete implementation of an interface as opposed to simply a description of methods and bindings. They are also sometimes simply referred to as \&quot;APIs\&quot; in other contexts, such as the name of this message itself. See https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/glossary for detailed terminology.
