defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceManagement.V1.Model.Visibility do
  @moduledoc """
  &#x60;Visibility&#x60; defines restrictions for the visibility of service elements.  Restrictions are specified using visibility labels (e.g., TRUSTED_TESTER) that are elsewhere linked to users and projects.  Users and projects can have access to more than one visibility label. The effective visibility for multiple labels is the union of each label&#39;s elements, plus any unrestricted elements.  If an element and its parents have no restrictions, visibility is unconditionally granted.  Example:      visibility:       rules:       - selector: google.calendar.Calendar.EnhancedSearch         restriction: TRUSTED_TESTER       - selector: google.calendar.Calendar.Delegate         restriction: GOOGLE_INTERNAL  Here, all methods are publicly visible except for the restricted methods EnhancedSearch and Delegate.
