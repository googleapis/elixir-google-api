  Usage configuration rules for the service.  NOTE: Under development.   Use this rule to configure unregistered calls for the service. Unregistered calls are calls that do not contain consumer project identity. (Example: calls that do not contain an API key). By default, API methods do not allow unregistered calls, and each method call must be identified by a consumer project identity. Use this rule to allow/disallow unregistered calls.  Example of an API that wants to allow unregistered calls for entire service.      usage:       rules:       - selector: \&quot;*\&quot;         allow_unregistered_calls: true  Example of a method that wants to allow unregistered calls.      usage:       rules:       - selector: \&quot;google.example.library.v1.LibraryService.CreateBook\&quot;         allow_unregistered_calls: true
