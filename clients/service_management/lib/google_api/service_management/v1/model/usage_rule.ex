defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceManagement.V1.Model.UsageRule do
  @moduledoc """
  Usage configuration rules for the service.

  NOTE: Under development.


  Use this rule to configure unregistered calls for the service. Unregistered
  calls are calls that do not contain consumer project identity.
  (Example: calls that do not contain an API key).
  By default, API methods do not allow unregistered calls, and each method call
  must be identified by a consumer project identity. Use this rule to
  allow/disallow unregistered calls.

  Example of an API that wants to allow unregistered calls for entire service.

      usage:
        rules:
        - selector: "*"
          allow_unregistered_calls: true

  Example of a method that wants to allow unregistered calls.

      usage:
        rules:
        - selector: "google.example.library.v1.LibraryService.CreateBook"
          allow_unregistered_calls: true

  ## Attributes

  *   `allowUnregisteredCalls` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - If true, the selected method allows unregistered calls, e.g. calls
      that don't identify any user or application.
  *   `selector` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Selects the methods to which this rule applies. Use '*' to indicate all
      methods in all APIs.

      Refer to selector for syntax details.
  *   `skipServiceControl` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - If true, the selected method should skip service control and the control
      plane features, such as quota and billing, will not be available.
      This flag is used by Google Cloud Endpoints to bypass checks for internal
      methods, such as service health check methods.
