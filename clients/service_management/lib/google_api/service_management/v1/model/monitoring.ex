defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceManagement.V1.Model.Monitoring do
  @moduledoc """
  Monitoring configuration of the service.

  The example below shows how to configure monitored resources and metrics
  for monitoring. In the example, a monitored resource and two metrics are
  defined. The `library.googleapis.com/book/returned_count` metric is sent
  to both producer and consumer projects, whereas the
  `library.googleapis.com/book/overdue_count` metric is only sent to the
  consumer project.

    monitored_resources:
    - type: library.googleapis.com/branch
      labels:
      - key: /city
        description: The city where the library branch is located in.
      - key: /name
        description: The name of the branch.
    metrics:
    - name: library.googleapis.com/book/returned_count
      metric_kind: DELTA
      value_type: INT64
      labels:
      - key: /customer_id
    - name: library.googleapis.com/book/overdue_count
      metric_kind: GAUGE
      value_type: INT64
      labels:
      - key: /customer_id
    monitoring:
      producer_destinations:
      - monitored_resource: library.googleapis.com/branch
        metrics:
        - library.googleapis.com/book/returned_count
      consumer_destinations:
      - monitored_resource: library.googleapis.com/branch
        metrics:
        - library.googleapis.com/book/returned_count
        - library.googleapis.com/book/overdue_count

  ## Attributes

  - consumerDestinations (list(GoogleApi.ServiceManagement.V1.Model.MonitoringDestination.t)): Monitoring configurations for sending metrics to the consumer project.
  There can be multiple consumer destinations. A monitored resouce type may
  appear in multiple monitoring destinations if different aggregations are
  needed for different sets of metrics associated with that monitored
  resource type. A monitored resource and metric pair may only be used once
  in the Monitoring configuration. Defaults to `nil`.
  - producerDestinations (list(GoogleApi.ServiceManagement.V1.Model.MonitoringDestination.t)): Monitoring configurations for sending metrics to the producer project.
  There can be multiple producer destinations. A monitored resouce type may
  appear in multiple monitoring destinations if different aggregations are
  needed for different sets of metrics associated with that monitored
  resource type. A monitored resource and metric pair may only be used once
  in the Monitoring configuration. Defaults to `nil`.
