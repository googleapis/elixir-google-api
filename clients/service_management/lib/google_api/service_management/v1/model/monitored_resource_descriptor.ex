defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceManagement.V1.Model.MonitoredResourceDescriptor do
  @moduledoc """
  An object that describes the schema of a MonitoredResource object using a type name and a set of labels.  For example, the monitored resource descriptor for Google Compute Engine VM instances has a type of &#x60;\&quot;gce_instance\&quot;&#x60; and specifies the use of the labels &#x60;\&quot;instance_id\&quot;&#x60; and &#x60;\&quot;zone\&quot;&#x60; to identify particular VM instances.  Different APIs can support different monitored resource types. APIs generally provide a &#x60;list&#x60; method that returns the monitored resource descriptors used by the API.
