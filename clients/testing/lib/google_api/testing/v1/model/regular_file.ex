defmodule GoogleApi.Testing.V1.Model.RegularFile do
  @moduledoc """
  A file or directory to install on the device before the test starts.

  ## Attributes

  - content (GoogleApi.Testing.V1.Model.FileReference.t): Required. The source file. Defaults to `nil`.
  - devicePath (String.t): Required. Where to put the content on the device. Must be an absolute,
  whitelisted path. If the file exists, it will be replaced.
  The following device-side directories and any of their subdirectories are
  whitelisted:
  <p>${EXTERNAL_STORAGE}, or /sdcard</p>
  <p>${ANDROID_DATA}/local/tmp, or /data/local/tmp</p>
  <p>Specifying a path outside of these directory trees is invalid.

  <p> The paths /sdcard and /data will be made available and treated as
  implicit path substitutions. E.g. if /sdcard on a particular device does
  not map to external storage, the system will replace it with the external
  storage path prefix for that device and copy the file there.

  <p> It is strongly advised to use the <a href=
  "http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Environment.html">
  Environment API</a> in app and test code to access files on the device in a
  portable way. Defaults to `nil`.
