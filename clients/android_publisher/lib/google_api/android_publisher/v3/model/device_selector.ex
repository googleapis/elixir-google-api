defmodule GoogleApi.AndroidPublisher.V3.Model.DeviceSelector do
  @moduledoc """
  Selector for a device group. A selector consists of a set of conditions on the device that should all match (logical AND) to determine a device group eligibility. For instance, if a selector specifies RAM conditions, device model inclusion and device model exclusion, a device is considered to match if: device matches RAM conditions AND device matches one of the included device models AND device doesn't match excluded device models

  ## Attributes

  *   `deviceRam` (*type:* `GoogleApi.AndroidPublisher.V3.Model.DeviceRam.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Conditions on the device's RAM.
  *   `excludedDeviceIds` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.AndroidPublisher.V3.Model.DeviceId.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Device models excluded by this selector, even if they match all other conditions.
  *   `forbiddenSystemFeatures` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.AndroidPublisher.V3.Model.SystemFeature.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - A device that has any of these system features is excluded by this selector, even if it matches all other conditions.
  *   `includedDeviceIds` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.AndroidPublisher.V3.Model.DeviceId.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Device models included by this selector.
  *   `requiredSystemFeatures` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.AndroidPublisher.V3.Model.SystemFeature.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - A device needs to have all these system features to be included by the selector.
