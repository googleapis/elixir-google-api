Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: `\\p{Ll}\\p{Lo}{0,62}` Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: `[\\p{Ll}\\p{Lo}\\p{N}_-]{0,63}` No more than 64 labels can be assigned to a given resource.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The resource name of the Secret in the format `projects/*/secrets/*`.
  *   `replication` (*type:* `GoogleApi.SecretManager.V1beta1.Model.Replication.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. Immutable. The replication policy of the secret data attached to the Secret. The replication policy cannot be changed after the Secret has been created.
