  **DEPRECATED.** _Auto-provisioning of these resources is changing, so this object no longer reliably provides information about the resources within the Project. Instead, retrieve information about each resource directly from its resource-specific API._ The default auto-provisioned resources associated with the Project.

  ## Attributes

  *   `hostingSite` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. **DEPRECATED.** _Instead, find the name of the default Firebase Hosting site using [ListSites](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/hosting/rest/v1beta1/projects.sites/list) within the Firebase Hosting REST API. If the default Hosting site for the Project has not yet been provisioned, the return might not contain a default site._ The name of the default Firebase Hosting site, in the format: PROJECT_ID Though rare, your `projectId` might already be used as the name for an existing Hosting site in another project (learn more about creating non-default, [additional sites](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/multisites)). In these cases, your `projectId` is appended with a hyphen then five alphanumeric characters to create your default Hosting site name. For example, if your `projectId` is `myproject123`, your default Hosting site name might be: `myproject123-a5c16`
  *   `locationId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. **DEPRECATED.** _Instead, use product-specific REST APIs to find the location of each resource in a Project. This field may not be populated, especially for newly provisioned projects after October 30, 2024._ The ID of the Project's ["location for default Google Cloud resources"](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/locations#default-cloud-location), which are resources associated with Google App Engine. The location is one of the available [Google App Engine locations](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations#region). This field is omitted if the location for default Google Cloud resources has not been set.
  *   `realtimeDatabaseInstance` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. **DEPRECATED.** _Instead, find the name of the default Realtime Database instance using the [list endpoint](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/database/database-management/rest/v1beta/projects.locations.instances/list) within the Firebase Realtime Database REST API. If the default Realtime Database instance for a Project has not yet been provisioned, the return might not contain a default instance._ The default Firebase Realtime Database instance name, in the format: PROJECT_ID Though rare, your `projectId` might already be used as the name for an existing Realtime Database instance in another project (learn more about [database sharding](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/usage/sharding)). In these cases, your `projectId` is appended with a hyphen then five alphanumeric characters to create your default Realtime Database instance name. For example, if your `projectId` is `myproject123`, your default database instance name might be: `myproject123-a5c16`
  *   `storageBucket` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. **DEPRECATED.** _Instead, find the name of the default Cloud Storage for Firebase bucket using the [list endpoint](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/storage/rest/v1beta/projects.buckets/list) within the Cloud Storage for Firebase REST API. If the default bucket for the Project has not yet been provisioned, the return might not contain a default bucket._ The name of the default Cloud Storage for Firebase bucket, in one of the following formats: * If provisioned _before_ October 30, 2024: PROJECT_ID.firebasestorage.app * If provisioned _on or after_ October 30, 2024: PROJECT_ID.firebasestorage.app
