defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceDirectory.V1.Model.Service do
  @moduledoc """
  An individual service. A service contains a name and optional metadata. A service must exist before endpoints can be added to it.

  ## Attributes

  *   `annotations` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. Annotations for the service. This data can be consumed by service clients. Restrictions: * The entire annotations dictionary may contain up to 2000 characters, spread accoss all key-value pairs. Annotations that go beyond this limit are rejected * Valid annotation keys have two segments: an optional prefix and name, separated by a slash (/). The name segment is required and must be 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alphanumerics between. The prefix is optional. If specified, the prefix must be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS labels separated by dots (.), not longer than 253 characters in total, followed by a slash (/). Annotations that fails to meet these requirements are rejected Note: This field is equivalent to the `metadata` field in the v1beta1 API. They have the same syntax and read/write to the same location in Service Directory.
  *   `endpoints` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.ServiceDirectory.V1.Model.Endpoint.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. Endpoints associated with this service. Returned on LookupService.ResolveService. Control plane clients should use RegistrationService.ListEndpoints.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Immutable. The resource name for the service in the format `projects/*/locations/*/namespaces/*/services/*`.
