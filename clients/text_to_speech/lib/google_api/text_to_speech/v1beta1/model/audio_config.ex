  Description of audio data to be synthesized.

  ## Attributes

  *   `audioEncoding` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The format of the audio byte stream.
  *   `effectsProfileId` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Input only. Optional. An identifier which selects 'audio effects' profiles
      that are applied on (post synthesized) text to speech. Effects are applied
      on top of each other in the order they are given. See
      [audio
      profiles](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/audio-profiles) for
      current supported profile ids.
  *   `pitch` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Input only. Optional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means
      increase 20 semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20
      semitones from the original pitch.
  *   `sampleRateHertz` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - The synthesis sample rate (in hertz) for this audio. Optional. When this is
      specified in SynthesizeSpeechRequest, if this is different from the voice's
      natural sample rate, then the synthesizer will honor this request by
      converting to the desired sample rate (which might result in worse audio
      quality), unless the specified sample rate is not supported for the
      encoding chosen, in which case it will fail the request and return
      google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT.
  *   `speakingRate` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Input only. Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is
      the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as
      fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0
      speed. Any other values < 0.25 or > 4.0 will return an error.
  *   `volumeGainDb` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Input only. Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume
      supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or
      set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A
      value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the
      normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at
      approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude.
      Strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective
      increase in loudness for any value greater than that.
