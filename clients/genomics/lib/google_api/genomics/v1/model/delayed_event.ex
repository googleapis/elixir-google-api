defmodule GoogleApi.Genomics.V1.Model.DelayedEvent do
  @moduledoc """
  An event generated whenever a resource limitation or transient error
  delays execution of a pipeline that was otherwise ready to run.

  ## Attributes

  - cause (String.t): A textual description of the cause of the delay. The string can change
  without notice because it is often generated by another service (such as
  Compute Engine). Defaults to `nil`.
  - metrics (list(String.t)): If the delay was caused by a resource shortage, this field lists the
  Compute Engine metrics that are preventing this operation from running
  (for example, `CPUS` or `INSTANCES`). If the particular metric is not
  known, a single `UNKNOWN` metric will be present. Defaults to `nil`.
