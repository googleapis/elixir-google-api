defmodule GoogleApi.Genomics.V1.Model.Annotation do
  @moduledoc """
  An annotation describes a region of reference genome. The value of an annotation may be one of several canonical types, supplemented by arbitrary info tags. An annotation is not inherently associated with a specific sample or individual (though a client could choose to use annotations in this way). Example canonical annotation types are &#x60;GENE&#x60; and &#x60;VARIANT&#x60;.
