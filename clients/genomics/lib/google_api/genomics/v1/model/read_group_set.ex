  A read group set is a logical collection of read groups, which are collections of reads produced by a sequencer. A read group set typically models reads corresponding to one sample, sequenced one way, and aligned one way.  * A read group set belongs to one dataset. * A read group belongs to one read group set. * A read belongs to one read group.
