defmodule GoogleApi.Genomics.V2alpha1.Model.Pipeline do
  @moduledoc """
  Specifies a series of actions to execute, expressed as Docker containers.

  ## Attributes

  *   `actions` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.Genomics.V2alpha1.Model.Action.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The list of actions to execute, in the order they are specified.
  *   `encryptedEnvironment` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Genomics.V2alpha1.Model.Secret.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The encrypted environment to pass into every action. Each action can also specify its own encrypted environment. The secret must decrypt to a JSON-encoded dictionary where key-value pairs serve as environment variable names and their values. The decoded environment variables can overwrite the values specified by the `environment` field.
  *   `environment` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - The environment to pass into every action. Each action can also specify additional environment variables but cannot delete an entry from this map (though they can overwrite it with a different value).
  *   `resources` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Genomics.V2alpha1.Model.Resources.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The resources required for execution.
  *   `timeout` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The maximum amount of time to give the pipeline to complete. This includes the time spent waiting for a worker to be allocated. If the pipeline fails to complete before the timeout, it will be cancelled and the error code will be set to DEADLINE_EXCEEDED. If unspecified, it will default to 7 days.
