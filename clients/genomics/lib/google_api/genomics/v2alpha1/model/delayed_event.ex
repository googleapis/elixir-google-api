defmodule GoogleApi.Genomics.V2alpha1.Model.DelayedEvent do
  @moduledoc """
  An event generated whenever a resource limitation or transient error delays execution of a pipeline that was otherwise ready to run.

  ## Attributes

  *   `cause` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A textual description of the cause of the delay. The string can change without notice because it is often generated by another service (such as Compute Engine).
  *   `metrics` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - If the delay was caused by a resource shortage, this field lists the Compute Engine metrics that are preventing this operation from running (for example, `CPUS` or `INSTANCES`). If the particular metric is not known, a single `UNKNOWN` metric will be present.
