defmodule GoogleApi.CloudKMS.V1.Model.CryptoKeyVersion do
  @moduledoc """
  A CryptoKeyVersion represents an individual cryptographic key, and the
  associated key material.

  An ENABLED version can be
  used for cryptographic operations.

  For security reasons, the raw cryptographic key material represented by a
  CryptoKeyVersion can never be viewed or exported. It can only be used to
  encrypt, decrypt, or sign data when an authorized user or application invokes
  Cloud KMS.

  ## Attributes

  - algorithm (String.t): Output only. The CryptoKeyVersionAlgorithm that this
  CryptoKeyVersion supports. Defaults to `nil`.
  - attestation (GoogleApi.CloudKMS.V1.Model.KeyOperationAttestation.t): Output only. Statement that was generated and signed by the HSM at key
  creation time. Use this statement to verify attributes of the key as stored
  on the HSM, independently of Google. Only provided for key versions with
  protection_level HSM. Defaults to `nil`.
  - createTime (DateTime.t): Output only. The time at which this CryptoKeyVersion was created. Defaults to `nil`.
  - destroyEventTime (DateTime.t): Output only. The time this CryptoKeyVersion's key material was
  destroyed. Only present if state is
  DESTROYED. Defaults to `nil`.
  - destroyTime (DateTime.t): Output only. The time this CryptoKeyVersion's key material is scheduled
  for destruction. Only present if state is
  DESTROY_SCHEDULED. Defaults to `nil`.
  - generateTime (DateTime.t): Output only. The time this CryptoKeyVersion's key material was
  generated. Defaults to `nil`.
  - name (String.t): Output only. The resource name for this CryptoKeyVersion in the format
  `projects/*/locations/*/keyRings/*/cryptoKeys/*/cryptoKeyVersions/*`. Defaults to `nil`.
  - protectionLevel (String.t): Output only. The ProtectionLevel describing how crypto operations are
  performed with this CryptoKeyVersion. Defaults to `nil`.
  - state (String.t): The current state of the CryptoKeyVersion. Defaults to `nil`.
