defmodule GoogleApi.CloudKMS.V1.Model.EkmConnection do
  @moduledoc """
  An EkmConnection represents an individual EKM connection. It can be used for creating CryptoKeys and CryptoKeyVersions with a ProtectionLevel of EXTERNAL_VPC, as well as performing cryptographic operations using keys created within the EkmConnection.

  ## Attributes

  *   `createTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The time at which the EkmConnection was created.
  *   `etag` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. Etag of the currently stored EkmConnection.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The resource name for the EkmConnection in the format `projects/*/locations/*/ekmConnections/*`.
  *   `serviceResolvers` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.CloudKMS.V1.Model.ServiceResolver.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - A list of ServiceResolvers where the EKM can be reached. There should be one ServiceResolver per EKM replica. Currently, only a single ServiceResolver is supported.
