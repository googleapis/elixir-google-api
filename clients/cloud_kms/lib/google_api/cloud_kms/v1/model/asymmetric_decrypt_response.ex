  Response message for KeyManagementService.AsymmetricDecrypt.

  ## Attributes

  *   `plaintext` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The decrypted data originally encrypted with the matching public key.
  *   `plaintextCrc32c` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Integrity verification field. A CRC32C checksum of the returned
      AsymmetricDecryptResponse.plaintext. An integrity check of
      AsymmetricDecryptResponse.plaintext can be performed by computing the
      CRC32C checksum of AsymmetricDecryptResponse.plaintext and comparing
      your results to this field. Discard the response in case of non-matching
      checksum values, and perform a limited number of retries. A persistent
      mismatch may indicate an issue in your computation of the CRC32C checksum.
      Note: This field is defined as int64 for reasons of compatibility across
      different languages. However, it is a non-negative integer, which will
      never exceed 2^32-1, and can be safely downconverted to uint32 in languages
      that support this type.

      NOTE: This field is in Beta.
  *   `verifiedCiphertextCrc32c` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Integrity verification field. A flag indicating whether
      AsymmetricDecryptRequest.ciphertext_crc32c was received by
      KeyManagementService and used for the integrity verification of the
      ciphertext. A false value of this
      field indicates either that AsymmetricDecryptRequest.ciphertext_crc32c
      was left unset or that it was not delivered to KeyManagementService. If
      you've set AsymmetricDecryptRequest.ciphertext_crc32c but this field is
      still false, discard the response and perform a limited number of retries.

      NOTE: This field is in Beta.
