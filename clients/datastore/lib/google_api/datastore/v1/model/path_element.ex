defmodule GoogleApi.Datastore.V1.Model.PathElement do
  @moduledoc """
  A (kind, ID/name) pair used to construct a key path. If either name or ID is set, the element is complete. If neither is set, the element is incomplete.

  ## Attributes

  *   `id` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The auto-allocated ID of the entity. Never equal to zero. Values less than zero are discouraged and may not be supported in the future.
  *   `kind` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The kind of the entity. A kind matching regex `__.*__` is reserved/read-only. A kind must not contain more than 1500 bytes when UTF-8 encoded. Cannot be `""`. Must be valid UTF-8 bytes. Legacy values that are not valid UTF-8 are encoded as `__bytes__` where `` is the base-64 encoding of the bytes.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The name of the entity. A name matching regex `__.*__` is reserved/read-only. A name must not be more than 1500 bytes when UTF-8 encoded. Cannot be `""`. Must be valid UTF-8 bytes. Legacy values that are not valid UTF-8 are encoded as `__bytes__` where `` is the base-64 encoding of the bytes.
