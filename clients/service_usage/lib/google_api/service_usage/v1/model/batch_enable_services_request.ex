defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceUsage.V1.Model.BatchEnableServicesRequest do

  Request message for the `BatchEnableServices` method.

  ## Attributes

  *   `serviceIds` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The identifiers of the services to enable on the project.

      A valid identifier would be:
      serviceusage.googleapis.com

      Enabling services requires that each service is public or is shared with
      the user enabling the service.

      A single request can enable a maximum of 20 services at a time. If more
      than 20 services are specified, the request will fail, and no state changes
      will occur.
