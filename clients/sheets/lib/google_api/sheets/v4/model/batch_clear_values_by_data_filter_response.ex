defmodule GoogleApi.Sheets.V4.Model.BatchClearValuesByDataFilterResponse do

  The response when clearing a range of values selected with
  DataFilters in a spreadsheet.

  ## Attributes

  *   `clearedRanges` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The ranges that were cleared, in A1 notation.
      (If the requests were for an unbounded range or a ranger larger
       than the bounds of the sheet, this will be the actual ranges
       that were cleared, bounded to the sheet's limits.)
  *   `spreadsheetId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The spreadsheet the updates were applied to.
