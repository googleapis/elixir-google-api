defmodule GoogleApi.Sheets.V4.Model.BatchClearValuesByDataFilterResponse do
  @moduledoc """
  The response when clearing a range of values selected with DataFilters in a spreadsheet.

  ## Attributes

  *   `clearedRanges` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The ranges that were cleared, in [A1 notation](https://developers.google.com/workspace/sheets/api/guides/concepts#cell). If the requests are for an unbounded range or a ranger larger than the bounds of the sheet, this is the actual ranges that were cleared, bounded to the sheet's limits.
  *   `spreadsheetId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The spreadsheet the updates were applied to.
