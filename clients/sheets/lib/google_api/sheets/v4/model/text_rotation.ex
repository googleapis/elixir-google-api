defmodule GoogleApi.Sheets.V4.Model.TextRotation do
  @moduledoc """
  The rotation applied to text in a cell.

  ## Attributes

  - angle (integer()): The angle between the standard orientation and the desired orientation.
  Measured in degrees. Valid values are between -90 and 90. Positive
  angles are angled upwards, negative are angled downwards.

  Note: For LTR text direction positive angles are in the
  counterclockwise direction, whereas for RTL they are in the clockwise
  direction Defaults to `nil`.
  - vertical (boolean()): If true, text reads top to bottom, but the orientation of individual
  characters is unchanged.
  For example:

    | V |
    | e |
    | r |
    | t |
    | i |
    | c |
    | a |
    | l | Defaults to `nil`.
