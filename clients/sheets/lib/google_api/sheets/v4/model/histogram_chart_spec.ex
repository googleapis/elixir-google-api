  A &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/histogram\&quot;&gt;histogram chart&lt;/a&gt;. A histogram chart groups data items into bins, displaying each bin as a column of stacked items.  Histograms are used to display the distribution of a dataset.  Each column of items represents a range into which those items fall.  The number of bins can be chosen automatically or specified explicitly.
