defmodule GoogleApi.Sheets.V4.Model.DeveloperMetadataLookup do
  @moduledoc """
  Selects DeveloperMetadata that matches all of the specified fields.  For
  example, if only a metadata ID is specified this considers the
  DeveloperMetadata with that particular unique ID. If a metadata key is
  specified, this considers all developer metadata with that key.  If a
  key, visibility, and location type are all specified, this considers all
  developer metadata with that key and visibility that are associated with a
  location of that type.  In general, this
  selects all DeveloperMetadata that matches the intersection of all the
  specified fields; any field or combination of fields may be specified.

  ## Attributes

  - locationMatchingStrategy (String.t): Determines how this lookup matches the location.  If this field is
  specified as EXACT, only developer metadata associated on the exact
  location specified is matched.  If this field is specified to INTERSECTING,
  developer metadata associated on intersecting locations is also
  matched.  If left unspecified, this field assumes a default value of
  INTERSECTING.
  If this field is specified, a metadataLocation
  must also be specified. Defaults to `nil`.
  - locationType (String.t): Limits the selected developer metadata to those entries which are
  associated with locations of the specified type.  For example, when this
  field is specified as ROW this lookup
  only considers developer metadata associated on rows.  If the field is left
  unspecified, all location types are considered.  This field cannot be
  specified as SPREADSHEET when
  the locationMatchingStrategy
  is specified as INTERSECTING or when the
  metadataLocation is specified as a
  non-spreadsheet location: spreadsheet metadata cannot intersect any other
  developer metadata location.  This field also must be left unspecified when
  the locationMatchingStrategy
  is specified as EXACT. Defaults to `nil`.
  - metadataId (integer()): Limits the selected developer metadata to that which has a matching
  DeveloperMetadata.metadata_id. Defaults to `nil`.
  - metadataKey (String.t): Limits the selected developer metadata to that which has a matching
  DeveloperMetadata.metadata_key. Defaults to `nil`.
  - metadataLocation (GoogleApi.Sheets.V4.Model.DeveloperMetadataLocation.t): Limits the selected developer metadata to those entries associated with
  the specified location.  This field either matches exact locations or all
  intersecting locations according the specified
  locationMatchingStrategy. Defaults to `nil`.
  - metadataValue (String.t): Limits the selected developer metadata to that which has a matching
  DeveloperMetadata.metadata_value. Defaults to `nil`.
  - visibility (String.t): Limits the selected developer metadata to that which has a matching
  DeveloperMetadata.visibility.  If left unspecified, all developer
  metadata visibile to the requesting project is considered. Defaults to `nil`.
