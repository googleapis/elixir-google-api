defmodule GoogleApi.Sheets.V4.Model.HistogramRule do
  @moduledoc """
  Allows you to organize the numeric values in a source data column into buckets of a constant size. All values from HistogramRule.start to HistogramRule.end are placed into groups of size HistogramRule.interval. In addition, all values below HistogramRule.start are placed in one group, and all values above HistogramRule.end are placed in another. Only HistogramRule.interval is required, though if HistogramRule.start and HistogramRule.end are both provided, HistogramRule.start must be less than HistogramRule.end. For example, a pivot table showing average purchase amount by age that has 50+ rows:      +-----+-------------------+     | Age | AVERAGE of Amount |     +-----+-------------------+     | 16  |            $27.13 |     | 17  |             $5.24 |     | 18  |            $20.15 |     ...     +-----+-------------------+ could be turned into a pivot table that looks like the one below by applying a histogram group rule with a HistogramRule.start of 25, an HistogramRule.interval of 20, and an HistogramRule.end of 65.      +-------------+-------------------+     | Grouped Age | AVERAGE of Amount |     +-------------+-------------------+     | &lt; 25        |            $19.34 |     | 25-45       |            $31.43 |     | 45-65       |            $35.87 |     | &gt; 65        |            $27.55 |     +-------------+-------------------+     | Grand Total |            $29.12 |     +-------------+-------------------+

  ## Attributes

  - end (float()): The maximum value at which items are placed into buckets of constant size. Values above end are lumped into a single bucket. This field is optional. Defaults to: `null`.
  - interval (float()): The size of the buckets that are created. Must be positive. Defaults to: `null`.
  - start (float()): The minimum value at which items are placed into buckets of constant size. Values below start are lumped into a single bucket. This field is optional. Defaults to: `null`.
