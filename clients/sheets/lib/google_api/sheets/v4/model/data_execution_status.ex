defmodule GoogleApi.Sheets.V4.Model.DataExecutionStatus do
  @moduledoc """
  The data execution status. A data execution is created to sync a data source object with the latest data from a DataSource. It is usually scheduled to run at background, you can check its state to tell if an execution completes There are several scenarios where a data execution is triggered to run: * Adding a data source creates an associated data source sheet as well as a data execution to sync the data from the data source to the sheet. * Updating a data source creates a data execution to refresh the associated data source sheet similarly. * You can send refresh request to explicitly refresh one or multiple data source objects.

  ## Attributes

  *   `errorCode` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The error code.
  *   `errorMessage` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The error message, which may be empty.
  *   `lastRefreshTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Gets the time the data last successfully refreshed.
  *   `state` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The state of the data execution.
