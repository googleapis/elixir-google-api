  Settings to control how circular dependencies are resolved with iterative
  calculation.

  ## Attributes

  - convergenceThreshold (float()): When iterative calculation is enabled and successive results differ by
  less than this threshold value, the calculation rounds stop. Defaults to `nil`.
  - maxIterations (integer()): When iterative calculation is enabled, the maximum number of calculation
  rounds to perform. Defaults to `nil`.
