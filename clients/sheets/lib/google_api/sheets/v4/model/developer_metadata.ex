defmodule GoogleApi.Sheets.V4.Model.DeveloperMetadata do
  @moduledoc """
  Developer metadata associated with a location or object in a spreadsheet.
  Developer metadata may be used to associate arbitrary data with various
  parts of a spreadsheet and will remain associated at those locations as they
  move around and the spreadsheet is edited.  For example, if developer
  metadata is associated with row 5 and another row is then subsequently
  inserted above row 5, that original metadata will still be associated with
  the row it was first associated with (what is now row 6). If the associated
  object is deleted its metadata is deleted too.

  ## Attributes

  *   `location` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Sheets.V4.Model.DeveloperMetadataLocation.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The location where the metadata is associated.
  *   `metadataId` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - The spreadsheet-scoped unique ID that identifies the metadata. IDs may be
      specified when metadata is created, otherwise one will be randomly
      generated and assigned. Must be positive.
  *   `metadataKey` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The metadata key. There may be multiple metadata in a spreadsheet with the
      same key.  Developer metadata must always have a key specified.
  *   `metadataValue` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Data associated with the metadata's key.
  *   `visibility` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The metadata visibility.  Developer metadata must always have a visibility
      specified.
