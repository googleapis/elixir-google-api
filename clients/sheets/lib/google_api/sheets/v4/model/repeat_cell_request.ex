defmodule GoogleApi.Sheets.V4.Model.RepeatCellRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  Updates all cells in the range to the values in the given Cell object.
  Only the fields listed in the fields field are updated; others are
  unchanged.

  If writing a cell with a formula, the formula's ranges will automatically
  increment for each field in the range.
  For example, if writing a cell with formula `=A1` into range B2:C4,
  B2 would be `=A1`, B3 would be `=A2`, B4 would be `=A3`,
  C2 would be `=B1`, C3 would be `=B2`, C4 would be `=B3`.

  To keep the formula's ranges static, use the `$` indicator.
  For example, use the formula `=$A$1` to prevent both the row and the
  column from incrementing.

  ## Attributes

  *   `cell` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Sheets.V4.Model.CellData.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The data to write.
  *   `fields` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The fields that should be updated.  At least one field must be specified.
      The root `cell` is implied and should not be specified.
      A single `"*"` can be used as short-hand for listing every field.
  *   `range` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Sheets.V4.Model.GridRange.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The range to repeat the cell in.
