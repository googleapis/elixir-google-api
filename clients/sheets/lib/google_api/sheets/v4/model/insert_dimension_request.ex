defmodule GoogleApi.Sheets.V4.Model.InsertDimensionRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  Inserts rows or columns in a sheet at a particular index.

  ## Attributes

  - inheritFromBefore (boolean()): Whether dimension properties should be extended from the dimensions
  before or after the newly inserted dimensions.
  True to inherit from the dimensions before (in which case the start
  index must be greater than 0), and false to inherit from the dimensions
  after.

  For example, if row index 0 has red background and row index 1
  has a green background, then inserting 2 rows at index 1 can inherit
  either the green or red background.  If `inheritFromBefore` is true,
  the two new rows will be red (because the row before the insertion point
  was red), whereas if `inheritFromBefore` is false, the two new rows will
  be green (because the row after the insertion point was green). Defaults to `nil`.
  - range (GoogleApi.Sheets.V4.Model.DimensionRange.t): The dimensions to insert.  Both the start and end indexes must be bounded. Defaults to `nil`.
