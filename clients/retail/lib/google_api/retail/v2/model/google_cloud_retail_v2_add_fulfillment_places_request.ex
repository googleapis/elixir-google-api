  Request message for AddFulfillmentPlaces method.

  ## Attributes

  *   `addTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The time when the fulfillment updates are issued, used to prevent out-of-order updates on fulfillment information. If not provided, the internal system time will be used.
  *   `allowMissing` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - If set to true, and the Product is not found, the fulfillment information will still be processed and retained for at most 1 day and processed once the Product is created. If set to false, a NOT_FOUND error is returned if the Product is not found.
  *   `placeIds` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The IDs for this type, such as the store IDs for "pickup-in-store" or the region IDs for "same-day-delivery" to be added for this type. Duplicate IDs will be automatically ignored. At least 1 value is required, and a maximum of 2000 values are allowed. Each value must be a string with a length limit of 10 characters, matching the pattern `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+`, such as "store1" or "REGION-2". Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned. If the total number of place IDs exceeds 2000 for this type after adding, then the update will be rejected.
  *   `type` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The fulfillment type, including commonly used types (such as pickup in store and same day delivery), and custom types. Supported values: * "pickup-in-store" * "ship-to-store" * "same-day-delivery" * "next-day-delivery" * "custom-type-1" * "custom-type-2" * "custom-type-3" * "custom-type-4" * "custom-type-5" If this field is set to an invalid value other than these, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned. This field directly corresponds to Product.fulfillment_info.type.
