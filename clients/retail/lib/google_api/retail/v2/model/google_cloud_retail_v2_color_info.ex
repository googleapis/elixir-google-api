  The color information of a Product.

  ## Attributes

  *   `colorFamilies` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The standard color families. Strongly recommended to use the following standard color groups: "Red", "Pink", "Orange", "Yellow", "Purple", "Green", "Cyan", "Blue", "Brown", "White", "Gray", "Black" and "Mixed". Normally it is expected to have only 1 color family. May consider using single "Mixed" instead of multiple values. A maximum of 5 values are allowed. Each value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128 characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.

Each value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128 characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.
