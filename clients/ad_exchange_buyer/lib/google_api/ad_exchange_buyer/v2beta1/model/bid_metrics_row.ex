  - impressionsWon (MetricValue): The number of bids that won an impression. Defaults to: `null`.
  - measurableImpressions (MetricValue): The number of bids for which the corresponding impression was measurable for viewability (as defined by Active View). Defaults to: `null`.
  - rowDimensions (RowDimensions): The values of all dimensions associated with metric values in this row. Defaults to: `null`.
  - viewableImpressions (MetricValue): The number of bids for which the corresponding impression was viewable (as defined by Active View). Defaults to: `null`.
