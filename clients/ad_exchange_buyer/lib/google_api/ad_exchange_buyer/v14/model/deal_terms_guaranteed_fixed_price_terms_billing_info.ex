  ## Attributes

  - currencyConversionTimeMs (String.t): The timestamp (in ms since epoch) when the original reservation price for the deal was first converted to DFP currency. This is used to convert the contracted price into buyer&#39;s currency without discrepancy. Defaults to: `null`.
  - dfpLineItemId (String.t): The DFP line item id associated with this deal. For features like CPD, buyers can retrieve the DFP line item for billing reconciliation. Defaults to: `null`.
  - originalContractedQuantity (String.t): The original contracted quantity (# impressions) for this deal. To ensure delivery, sometimes the publisher will book the deal with a impression buffer, such that guaranteed_looks is greater than the contracted quantity. However clients are billed using the original contracted quantity. Defaults to: `null`.
  - price (Price): The original reservation price for the deal, if the currency code is different from the one used in negotiation. Defaults to: `null`.
