  *   `valuePerAllConversionsByConversionDate` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - The value of all conversions divided by the number of all conversions. When this column is selected with date, the values in date column means the conversion date. Details for the by_conversion_date columns are available at https://support.google.com/sa360/answer/9250611.
  *   `allConversionsFromStoreWebsite` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - The number of times that people were taken to a store's URL after clicking an ad. This metric applies to feed items only.

Any product included in the order the customer places is a sold product. If these products don't match then this is considered cross-sell. Cross-sell units sold is the total number of cross-sold products from all orders attributed to your ads. Example: Someone clicked on a Shopping ad for a hat then bought the same hat, a shirt and a jacket. The cross-sell units sold in this order is 2.

  *   `allConversionsFromInteractionsRate` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - All conversions from interactions (as oppose to view through conversions) divided by the number of ad interactions.
  *   `costMicros` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The sum of your cost-per-click (CPC) and cost-per-thousand impressions (CPM) costs during this period. This metric is a monetary value and returned in the customer's currency by default. See the metrics_currency parameter at https://developers.google.com/search-ads/reporting/query/query-structure#parameters_clause
  *   `interactionRate` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - How often people interact with your ad after it is shown to them. This is the number of interactions divided by the number of times your ad is shown.
  *   `mobileFriendlyClicksPercentage` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - The percentage of mobile clicks that go to a mobile-friendly page.
  *   `allConversionsValue` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - The value of all conversions.
  *   `clicks` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The number of clicks.
  *   `rawEventConversionMetrics` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.SearchAds360.V0.Model.GoogleAdsSearchads360V0Common_Value.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The raw event conversion metrics.
  *   `valuePerConversion` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - The value of biddable conversion divided by the number of biddable conversions. Shows how much, on average, each of the biddable conversions is worth.
  *   `conversionsFromInteractionsRate` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Average biddable conversions (from interaction) per conversion eligible interaction. Shows how often, on average, an ad interaction leads to a biddable conversion.
  *   `allConversionsFromInteractionsValuePerInteraction` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - The value of all conversions from interactions divided by the total number of interactions.
  *   `allConversionsFromOrder` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - The number of times people placed an order at a store after clicking an ad. This metric applies to feed items only.
  *   `costPerConversion` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Average conversion eligible cost per biddable conversion.
