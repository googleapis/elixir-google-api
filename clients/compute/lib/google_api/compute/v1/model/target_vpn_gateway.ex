defmodule GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.TargetVpnGateway do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents a Target VPN Gateway resource.

  The target VPN gateway resource represents a Classic Cloud VPN gateway. For more information, read the the Cloud VPN Overview. (== resource_for beta.targetVpnGateways ==) (== resource_for v1.targetVpnGateways ==)

  ## Attributes

  *   `creationTimestamp` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
  *   `description` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.
  *   `forwardingRules` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - [Output Only] A list of URLs to the ForwardingRule resources. ForwardingRules are created using compute.forwardingRules.insert and associated with a VPN gateway.
  *   `id` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.
  *   `kind` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `compute#targetVpnGateway`) - [Output Only] Type of resource. Always compute#targetVpnGateway for target VPN gateways.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
  *   `network` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - URL of the network to which this VPN gateway is attached. Provided by the client when the VPN gateway is created.
  *   `region` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - [Output Only] URL of the region where the target VPN gateway resides. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not settable as a field in the request body.
  *   `selfLink` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
  *   `status` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - [Output Only] The status of the VPN gateway, which can be one of the following: CREATING, READY, FAILED, or DELETING.
  *   `tunnels` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - [Output Only] A list of URLs to VpnTunnel resources. VpnTunnels are created using the compute.vpntunnels.insert method and associated with a VPN gateway.
