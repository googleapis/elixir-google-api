defmodule GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.TargetSslProxy do
  @moduledoc """
  A TargetSslProxy resource. This resource defines an SSL proxy. (&#x3D;&#x3D; resource_for beta.targetSslProxies &#x3D;&#x3D;) (&#x3D;&#x3D; resource_for v1.targetSslProxies &#x3D;&#x3D;)

  ## Attributes

  - creationTimestamp (String.t): [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format. Defaults to: `null`.
  - description (String.t): An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String.t): [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String.t): [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#targetSslProxy for target SSL proxies. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression &#x60;[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?&#x60; which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. Defaults to: `null`.
  - proxyHeader (String.t): Specifies the type of proxy header to append before sending data to the backend, either NONE or PROXY_V1. The default is NONE. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [NONE, PROXY_V1]
  - selfLink (String.t): [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - service (String.t): URL to the BackendService resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sslCertificates ([String.t]): URLs to SslCertificate resources that are used to authenticate connections to Backends. Currently exactly one SSL certificate must be specified. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sslPolicy (String.t): URL of SslPolicy resource that will be associated with the TargetSslProxy resource. If not set, the TargetSslProxy resource will not have any SSL policy configured. Defaults to: `null`.
