  ## Attributes

  - IPProtocol (String.t): The IP protocol to which this rule applies. The protocol type is required when creating a firewall rule. This value can either be one of the following well known protocol strings (tcp, udp, icmp, esp, ah, ipip, sctp) or the IP protocol number. Defaults to: `null`.
  - ports ([String.t]): An optional list of ports to which this rule applies. This field is only applicable for the UDP or TCP protocol. Each entry must be either an integer or a range. If not specified, this rule applies to connections through any port.  Example inputs include: [\&quot;22\&quot;], [\&quot;80\&quot;,\&quot;443\&quot;], and [\&quot;12345-12349\&quot;]. Defaults to: `null`.
