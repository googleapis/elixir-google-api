  ## Attributes

  *   `fingerprint` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Fingerprint of this per-instance config. This field may be used in optimistic locking. It will be ignored when inserting a per-instance config. An up-to-date fingerprint must be provided in order to update an existing per-instance config or the field needs to be unset.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The name of the per-instance config and the corresponding instance. Serves as a merge key during UpdatePerInstanceConfigs operation, i.e. if per-instance config with the same name exists then it will be updated, otherwise a new one will be created for the VM instance with the same name. An attempt to create a per-instance config for a VM instance that either doesn't exist or is not part of the group will result in a failure.
