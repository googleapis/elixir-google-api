defmodule GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.NetworkInterface do
  @moduledoc """
  A network interface resource attached to an instance.

  ## Attributes

  - accessConfigs ([AccessConfig]): An array of configurations for this interface. Currently, only one access config, ONE_TO_ONE_NAT, is supported. If there are no accessConfigs specified, then this instance will have no external internet access. Defaults to: `null`.
  - aliasIpRanges ([AliasIpRange]): An array of alias IP ranges for this network interface. You can only specify this field for network interfaces in VPC networks. Defaults to: `null`.
  - fingerprint (binary()): Fingerprint hash of contents stored in this network interface. This field will be ignored when inserting an Instance or adding a NetworkInterface. An up-to-date fingerprint must be provided in order to update the NetworkInterface, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String.t): [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#networkInterface for network interfaces. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): [Output Only] The name of the network interface, which is generated by the server. For network devices, these are eth0, eth1, etc. Defaults to: `null`.
  - network (String.t): URL of the network resource for this instance. When creating an instance, if neither the network nor the subnetwork is specified, the default network global/networks/default is used; if the network is not specified but the subnetwork is specified, the network is inferred.  If you specify this property, you can specify the network as a full or partial URL. For example, the following are all valid URLs:   - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/global/networks/network  - projects/project/global/networks/network  - global/networks/default Defaults to: `null`.
  - networkIP (String.t): An IPv4 internal IP address to assign to the instance for this network interface. If not specified by the user, an unused internal IP is assigned by the system. Defaults to: `null`.
  - subnetwork (String.t): The URL of the Subnetwork resource for this instance. If the network resource is in legacy mode, do not specify this field. If the network is in auto subnet mode, specifying the subnetwork is optional. If the network is in custom subnet mode, specifying the subnetwork is required. If you specify this field, you can specify the subnetwork as a full or partial URL. For example, the following are all valid URLs:   - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/regions/region/subnetworks/subnetwork  - regions/region/subnetworks/subnetwork Defaults to: `null`.
