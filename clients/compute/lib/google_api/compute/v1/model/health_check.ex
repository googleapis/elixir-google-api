defmodule GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.HealthCheck do
  @moduledoc """
  An HealthCheck resource. This resource defines a template for how individual virtual machines should be checked for health, via one of the supported protocols.

  ## Attributes

  - checkIntervalSec (integer()): How often (in seconds) to send a health check. The default value is 5 seconds. Defaults to: `null`.
  - creationTimestamp (String.t): [Output Only] Creation timestamp in 3339 text format. Defaults to: `null`.
  - description (String.t): An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - healthyThreshold (integer()): A so-far unhealthy instance will be marked healthy after this many consecutive successes. The default value is 2. Defaults to: `null`.
  - http2HealthCheck (Http2HealthCheck):  Defaults to: `null`.
  - httpHealthCheck (HttpHealthCheck):  Defaults to: `null`.
  - httpsHealthCheck (HttpsHealthCheck):  Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String.t): [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String.t): Type of the resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression &#x60;[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?&#x60; which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. Defaults to: `null`.
  - selfLink (String.t): [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sslHealthCheck (SslHealthCheck):  Defaults to: `null`.
  - tcpHealthCheck (TcpHealthCheck):  Defaults to: `null`.
  - timeoutSec (integer()): How long (in seconds) to wait before claiming failure. The default value is 5 seconds. It is invalid for timeoutSec to have greater value than checkIntervalSec. Defaults to: `null`.
  - type (String.t): Specifies the type of the healthCheck, either TCP, SSL, HTTP or HTTPS. If not specified, the default is TCP. Exactly one of the protocol-specific health check field must be specified, which must match type field. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [HTTP, HTTP2, HTTPS, INVALID, SSL, TCP]
  - unhealthyThreshold (integer()): A so-far healthy instance will be marked unhealthy after this many consecutive failures. The default value is 2. Defaults to: `null`.
