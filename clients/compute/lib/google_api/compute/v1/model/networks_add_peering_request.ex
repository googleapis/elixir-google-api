  ## Attributes

  - autoCreateRoutes (boolean()): This field will be deprecated soon. Prefer using exchange_subnet_routes in network_peering instead. Whether Google Compute Engine manages the routes automatically. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): Name of the peering, which should conform to RFC1035. Defaults to: `null`.
  - networkPeering (NetworkPeering): Network peering parameters. In order to specify route policies for peering using import/export custom routes, you will have to fill all peering related parameters (name, peer network, exchange_subnet_routes) in network_peeringfield. Corresponding fields in NetworksAddPeeringRequest will be deprecated soon. Defaults to: `null`.
  - peerNetwork (String.t): URL of the peer network. It can be either full URL or partial URL. The peer network may belong to a different project. If the partial URL does not contain project, it is assumed that the peer network is in the same project as the current network. Defaults to: `null`.
