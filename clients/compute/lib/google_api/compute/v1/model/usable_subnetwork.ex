  Subnetwork which the current user has compute.subnetworks.use permission on.

  ## Attributes

  *   `externalIpv6Prefix` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - [Output Only] The external IPv6 address range that is assigned to this subnetwork.
  *   `internalIpv6Prefix` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - [Output Only] The internal IPv6 address range that is assigned to this subnetwork.
  *   `ipCidrRange` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The range of internal addresses that are owned by this subnetwork.
  *   `ipv6AccessType` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The access type of IPv6 address this subnet holds. It's immutable and can only be specified during creation or the first time the subnet is updated into IPV4_IPV6 dual stack.
  *   `network` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Network URL.
  *   `purpose` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The purpose of the resource. This field can be either PRIVATE_RFC_1918 or INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER. A subnetwork with purpose set to INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER is a user-created subnetwork that is reserved for Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing. If unspecified, the purpose defaults to PRIVATE_RFC_1918. The enableFlowLogs field isn't supported with the purpose field set to INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER.
  *   `role` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The role of subnetwork. Currently, this field is only used when purpose = INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER. The value can be set to ACTIVE or BACKUP. An ACTIVE subnetwork is one that is currently being used for Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing. A BACKUP subnetwork is one that is ready to be promoted to ACTIVE or is currently draining. This field can be updated with a patch request.
  *   `secondaryIpRanges` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.UsableSubnetworkSecondaryRange.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Secondary IP ranges.
  *   `stackType` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The stack type for the subnet. If set to IPV4_ONLY, new VMs in the subnet are assigned IPv4 addresses only. If set to IPV4_IPV6, new VMs in the subnet can be assigned both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. If not specified, IPV4_ONLY is used. This field can be both set at resource creation time and updated using patch.
  *   `subnetwork` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Subnetwork URL.
