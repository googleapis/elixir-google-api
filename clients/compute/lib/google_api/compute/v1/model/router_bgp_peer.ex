  ## Attributes

  - advertiseMode (String.t): User-specified flag to indicate which mode to use for advertisement. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [CUSTOM, DEFAULT]
  - advertisedGroups ([String.t]): User-specified list of prefix groups to advertise in custom mode. This field can only be populated if advertise_mode is CUSTOM and overrides the list defined for the router (in Bgp message). These groups will be advertised in addition to any specified prefixes. Leave this field blank to advertise no custom groups. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of 
  - advertisedIpRanges ([RouterAdvertisedIpRange]): User-specified list of individual IP ranges to advertise in custom mode. This field can only be populated if advertise_mode is CUSTOM and overrides the list defined for the router (in Bgp message). These IP ranges will be advertised in addition to any specified groups. Leave this field blank to advertise no custom IP ranges. Defaults to: `null`.
  - advertisedRoutePriority (integer()): The priority of routes advertised to this BGP peer. In the case where there is more than one matching route of maximum length, the routes with lowest priority value win. Defaults to: `null`.
  - interfaceName (String.t): Name of the interface the BGP peer is associated with. Defaults to: `null`.
  - ipAddress (String.t): IP address of the interface inside Google Cloud Platform. Only IPv4 is supported. Defaults to: `null`.
  - managementType (String.t): [Output Only] Type of how the resource/configuration of the BGP peer is managed. MANAGED_BY_USER is the default value; MANAGED_BY_ATTACHMENT represents an BGP peer that is automatically created for PARTNER interconnectAttachment, Google will automatically create/delete this type of BGP peer when the PARTNER interconnectAttachment is created/deleted. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [MANAGED_BY_ATTACHMENT, MANAGED_BY_USER]
  - name (String.t): Name of this BGP peer. The name must be 1-63 characters long and comply with RFC1035. Defaults to: `null`.
  - peerAsn (integer()): Peer BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN). For VPN use case, this value can be different for every tunnel. Defaults to: `null`.
  - peerIpAddress (String.t): IP address of the BGP interface outside Google cloud. Only IPv4 is supported. Defaults to: `null`.
