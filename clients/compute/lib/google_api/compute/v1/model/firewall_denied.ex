  ## Attributes

  *   `IPProtocol` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The IP protocol to which this rule applies. The protocol type is required when creating a firewall rule. This value can either be one of the following well known protocol strings (tcp, udp, icmp, esp, ah, ipip, sctp) or the IP protocol number.
  *   `ports` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - An optional list of ports to which this rule applies. This field is only applicable for the UDP or TCP protocol. Each entry must be either an integer or a range. If not specified, this rule applies to connections through any port.

      Example inputs include: ["22"], ["80","443"], and ["12345-12349"].
