defmodule GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.RequestMirrorPolicy do
  @moduledoc """
  A policy that specifies how requests intended for the route's backends are shadowed to a separate mirrored backend service. The load balancer doesn't wait for responses from the shadow service. Before sending traffic to the shadow service, the host or authority header is suffixed with -shadow.

  ## Attributes

  *   `backendService` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The full or partial URL to the BackendService resource being mirrored to. The backend service configured for a mirroring policy must reference backends that are of the same type as the original backend service matched in the URL map. Serverless NEG backends are not currently supported as a mirrored backend service.
