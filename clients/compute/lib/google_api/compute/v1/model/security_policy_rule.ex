defmodule GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.SecurityPolicyRule do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents a rule that describes one or more match conditions along with the action to be taken when traffic matches this condition (allow or deny).

  ## Attributes

  *   `action` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The Action to preform when the client connection triggers the rule. Can currently be either "allow" or "deny()" where valid values for status are 403, 404, and 502.
  *   `description` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.
  *   `kind` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `compute#securityPolicyRule`) - [Output only] Type of the resource. Always compute#securityPolicyRule for security policy rules
  *   `match` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.SecurityPolicyRuleMatcher.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A match condition that incoming traffic is evaluated against. If it evaluates to true, the corresponding ?action? is enforced.
  *   `preview` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - If set to true, the specified action is not enforced.
  *   `priority` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - An integer indicating the priority of a rule in the list. The priority must be a positive value between 0 and 2147483647. Rules are evaluated from highest to lowest priority where 0 is the highest priority and 2147483647 is the lowest prority.
