  ## Attributes

  *   `state` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The status of the current value when compared to the warning and alarm levels for the receiving or transmitting transceiver. Possible states include:  
      - OK: The value has not crossed a warning threshold. 
      - LOW_WARNING: The value has crossed below the low warning threshold. 
      - HIGH_WARNING: The value has crossed above the high warning threshold. 
      - LOW_ALARM: The value has crossed below the low alarm threshold. 
      - HIGH_ALARM: The value has crossed above the high alarm threshold.
  *   `value` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - Value of the current receiving or transmitting optical power, read in dBm. Take a known good optical value, give it a 10% margin and trigger warnings relative to that value. In general, a -7dBm warning and a -11dBm alarm are good optical value estimates for most links.
