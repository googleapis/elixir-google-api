defmodule GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.PathRule do
  @moduledoc """
  A path-matching rule for a URL. If matched, will use the specified BackendService to handle the traffic arriving at this URL.

  ## Attributes

  - paths ([String.t]): The list of path patterns to match. Each must start with / and the only place a * is allowed is at the end following a /. The string fed to the path matcher does not include any text after the first ? or #, and those chars are not allowed here. Defaults to: `null`.
  - service (String.t): The full or partial URL of the backend service resource to which traffic is directed if this rule is matched. If routeAction is additionally specified, advanced routing actions like URL Rewrites, etc. take effect prior to sending the request to the backend. However, if service is specified, routeAction cannot contain any weightedBackendService s. Conversely, if routeAction specifies any  weightedBackendServices, service must not be specified. Only one of urlRedirect, service or routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set. Defaults to: `null`.
