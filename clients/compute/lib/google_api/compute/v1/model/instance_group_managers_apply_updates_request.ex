  ## Attributes

  *   `allInstances` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Flag to update all instances instead of specified list of “instances”. If the flag is set to true then the instances may not be specified in the request.
  *   `instances` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The list of URLs of one or more instances for which you want to apply updates. Each URL can be a full URL or a partial URL, such as zones/[ZONE]/instances/[INSTANCE_NAME].
  *   `minimalAction` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The minimal action that you want to perform on each instance during the update: - REPLACE: At minimum, delete the instance and create it again. - RESTART: Stop the instance and start it again. - REFRESH: Do not stop the instance. - NONE: Do not disrupt the instance at all. By default, the minimum action is NONE. If your update requires a more disruptive action than you set with this flag, the necessary action is performed to execute the update.
  *   `mostDisruptiveAllowedAction` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The most disruptive action that you want to perform on each instance during the update: - REPLACE: Delete the instance and create it again. - RESTART: Stop the instance and start it again. - REFRESH: Do not stop the instance. - NONE: Do not disrupt the instance at all. By default, the most disruptive allowed action is REPLACE. If your update requires a more disruptive action than you set with this flag, the update request will fail.
