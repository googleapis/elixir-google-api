  ## Attributes

  - port (integer()): The TCP port number for the health check request. The default value is 443. Valid values are 1 through 65535. Defaults to `nil`.
  - portName (String.t): Port name as defined in InstanceGroup#NamedPort#name. If both port and port_name are defined, port takes precedence. Defaults to `nil`.
  - portSpecification (String.t): Specifies how port is selected for health checking, can be one of following values:
  USE_FIXED_PORT: The port number in
  port
  is used for health checking.
  USE_NAMED_PORT: The
  portName
  is used for health checking.
  USE_SERVING_PORT: For NetworkEndpointGroup, the port specified for each network endpoint is used for health checking. For other backends, the port or named port specified in the Backend Service is used for health checking.


  If not specified, SSL health check follows behavior specified in
  port
  and
  portName
  fields. Defaults to `nil`.
  - proxyHeader (String.t): Specifies the type of proxy header to append before sending data to the backend, either NONE or PROXY_V1. The default is NONE. Defaults to `nil`.
  - request (String.t): The application data to send once the SSL connection has been established (default value is empty). If both request and response are empty, the connection establishment alone will indicate health. The request data can only be ASCII. Defaults to `nil`.
  - response (String.t): The bytes to match against the beginning of the response data. If left empty (the default value), any response will indicate health. The response data can only be ASCII. Defaults to `nil`.
