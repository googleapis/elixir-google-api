defmodule GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.Duration do
  @moduledoc """
  A Duration represents a fixed-length span of time represented as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond resolution. It is independent of any calendar and concepts like "day" or "month". Range is approximately 10,000 years.

  ## Attributes

  *   `nanos` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Span of time that's a fraction of a second at nanosecond resolution. Durations less than one second are represented with a 0 `seconds` field and a positive `nanos` field. Must be from 0 to 999,999,999 inclusive.
  *   `seconds` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Span of time at a resolution of a second. Must be from 0 to 315,576,000,000 inclusive. Note: these bounds are computed from: 60 sec/min * 60 min/hr * 24 hr/day * 365.25 days/year * 10000 years
