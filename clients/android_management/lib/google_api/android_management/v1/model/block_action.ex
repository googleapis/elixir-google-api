defmodule GoogleApi.AndroidManagement.V1.Model.BlockAction do
  @moduledoc """
  An action to block access to apps and data on a fully managed device or in a work profile. This action also triggers a device or work profile to displays a user-facing notification with information (where possible) on how to correct the compliance issue. Note: wipeAction must also be specified.

  ## Attributes

  - blockAfterDays (integer()): Number of days the policy is non-compliant before the device or work profile is blocked. To block access immediately, set to 0. blockAfterDays must be less than wipeAfterDays. Defaults to `nil`.
