  @moduledoc """
  A resource containing sign in details for an enterprise.

  ## Attributes

  - qrCode (String.t): A JSON string whose UTF-8 representation can be used to generate a QR code to enroll a device with this enrollment token. To enroll a device using NFC, the NFC record must contain a serialized java.util.Properties representation of the properties in the JSON. This is a read-only field generated by the server. Defaults to: `null`.
  - signinEnrollmentToken (String.t): An enterprise wide enrollment token used to trigger custom sign-in flow. This is a read-only field generated by the server. Defaults to: `null`.
  - signinUrl (String.t): Sign-in URL for authentication when device is provisioned with a sign-in enrollment token. The sign-in endpoint should finish authentication flow with a URL in the form of https://enterprise.google.com/android/enroll?et&#x3D;&lt;token&gt; for a successful login, or https://enterprise.google.com/android/enroll/invalid for a failed login. Defaults to: `null`.
