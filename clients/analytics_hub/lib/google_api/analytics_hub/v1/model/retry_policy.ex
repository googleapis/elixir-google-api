defmodule GoogleApi.AnalyticsHub.V1.Model.RetryPolicy do
  @moduledoc """
  A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery. Retry delay will be exponential based on provided minimum and maximum backoffs. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff. RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline exceeded events for a given message. Retry Policy is implemented on a best effort basis. At times, the delay between consecutive deliveries may not match the configuration. That is, delay can be more or less than configured backoff.

  ## Attributes

  *   `maximumBackoff` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. The maximum delay between consecutive deliveries of a given message. Value should be between 0 and 600 seconds. Defaults to 600 seconds.
  *   `minimumBackoff` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. The minimum delay between consecutive deliveries of a given message. Value should be between 0 and 600 seconds. Defaults to 10 seconds.
