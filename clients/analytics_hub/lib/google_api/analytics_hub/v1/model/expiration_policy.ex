defmodule GoogleApi.AnalyticsHub.V1.Model.ExpirationPolicy do
  @moduledoc """
  A policy that specifies the conditions for resource expiration (i.e., automatic resource deletion).

  ## Attributes

  *   `ttl` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. Specifies the "time-to-live" duration for an associated resource. The resource expires if it is not active for a period of `ttl`. The definition of "activity" depends on the type of the associated resource. The minimum and maximum allowed values for `ttl` depend on the type of the associated resource, as well. If `ttl` is not set, the associated resource never expires.
