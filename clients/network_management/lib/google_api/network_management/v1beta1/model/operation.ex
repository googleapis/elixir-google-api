defmodule GoogleApi.NetworkManagement.V1beta1.Model.Operation do
  @moduledoc """
  This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.

  ## Attributes

  *   `done` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  *   `error` (*type:* `GoogleApi.NetworkManagement.V1beta1.Model.Status.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
  *   `metadata` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  *   `response` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
