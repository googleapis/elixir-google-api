  Hangouts Chat events.

  ## Attributes

  - action (FormAction): The form action data associated with an interactive card that was clicked. Only populated for CARD_CLICKED events. See the [Interactive Cards guide](/hangouts/chat/how-tos/cards-onclick) for more information. Defaults to: `null`.
  - configCompleteRedirectUrl (String.t): The URL the bot should redirect the user to after they have completed an authorization or configuration flow outside of Hangouts Chat. See the [Authorizing access to 3p services guide](/hangouts/chat/how-tos/auth-3p) for more information. Defaults to: `null`.
  - eventTime (DateTime.t): The timestamp indicating when the event was dispatched. Defaults to: `null`.

  - space (Space): The room or DM in which the event occurred. Defaults to: `null`.

  - token (String.t): A secret value that bots can use to verify if a request is from Google. The token is randomly generated by Google, remains static, and can be obtained from the Hangouts Chat API configuration page in the Cloud Console. Developers can revoke/regenerate it if needed from the same page. Defaults to: `null`.
