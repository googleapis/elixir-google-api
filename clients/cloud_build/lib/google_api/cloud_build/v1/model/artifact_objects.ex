  @moduledoc """
  Files in the workspace to upload to Cloud Storage upon successful completion of all build steps.

  ## Attributes

  - paths ([String.t]): Path globs used to match files in the build&#39;s workspace. Defaults to: `null`.
  - location (String.t): Cloud Storage bucket and optional object path, in the form \&quot;gs://bucket/path/to/somewhere/\&quot;. (see [Bucket Name Requirements](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/bucket-naming#requirements)).  Files in the workspace matching any path pattern will be uploaded to Cloud Storage with this location as a prefix. Defaults to: `null`.
  - timing (TimeSpan): Output only. Stores timing information for pushing all artifact objects. Defaults to: `null`.
