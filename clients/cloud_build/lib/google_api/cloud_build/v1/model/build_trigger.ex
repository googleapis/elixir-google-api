defmodule GoogleApi.CloudBuild.V1.Model.BuildTrigger do
  @moduledoc """
  Configuration for an automated build in response to source repository changes.

  ## Attributes

  - tags ([String.t]): Tags for annotation of a &#x60;BuildTrigger&#x60; Defaults to: `null`.
  - build (Build): Contents of the build template. Defaults to: `null`.
  - createTime (DateTime.t): Output only. Time when the trigger was created. Defaults to: `null`.
  - description (String.t): Human-readable description of this trigger. Defaults to: `null`.
  - disabled (boolean()): If true, the trigger will never result in a build. Defaults to: `null`.
  - filename (String.t): Path, from the source root, to a file whose contents is used for the template. Defaults to: `null`.
  - github (GitHubEventsConfig): GitHubEventsConfig describes the configuration of a trigger that creates a build whenever a GitHub event is received. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String.t): Output only. Unique identifier of the trigger. Defaults to: `null`.
  - ignoredFiles ([String.t]): ignored_files and included_files are file glob matches using http://godoc/pkg/path/filepath#Match extended with support for \&quot;**\&quot;.  If ignored_files and changed files are both empty, then they are not used to determine whether or not to trigger a build.  If ignored_files is not empty, then we ignore any files that match any of the ignored_file globs. If the change has no files that are outside of the ignored_files globs, then we do not trigger a build. Defaults to: `null`.
  - includedFiles ([String.t]): If any of the files altered in the commit pass the ignored_files filter and included_files is empty, then as far as this filter is concerned, we should trigger the build.  If any of the files altered in the commit pass the ignored_files filter and included_files is not empty, then we make sure that at least one of those files matches a included_files glob. If not, then we do not trigger a build. Defaults to: `null`.
  - substitutions (%{optional(String.t) &#x3D;&gt; String.t}): Substitutions data for Build resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - triggerTemplate (RepoSource): Template describing the types of source changes to trigger a build.  Branch and tag names in trigger templates are interpreted as regular expressions. Any branch or tag change that matches that regular expression will trigger a build. Defaults to: `null`.
