  Optional arguments to enable specific features of builds.

  ## Attributes

  - diskSizeGb (String.t): Requested disk size for the VM that runs the build. Note that this is *NOT* \&quot;disk free\&quot;; some of the space will be used by the operating system and build utilities. Also note that this is the minimum disk size that will be allocated for the build -- the build may run with a larger disk than requested. At present, the maximum disk size is 1000GB; builds that request more than the maximum are rejected with an error. Defaults to: `null`.
  - logStreamingOption (String.t): Option to define build log streaming behavior to Google Cloud Storage. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [STREAM_DEFAULT, STREAM_ON, STREAM_OFF]
  - machineType (String.t): Compute Engine machine type on which to run the build. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [UNSPECIFIED, N1_HIGHCPU_8, N1_HIGHCPU_32]
  - requestedVerifyOption (String.t): Requested verifiability options. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [NOT_VERIFIED, VERIFIED]
  - sourceProvenanceHash ([String.t]): Requested hash for SourceProvenance. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of 
  - substitutionOption (String.t): Option to specify behavior when there is an error in the substitution checks. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [MUST_MATCH, ALLOW_LOOSE]
