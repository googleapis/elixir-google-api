defmodule GoogleApi.CloudBuild.V1.Model.WorkerPool do
  @moduledoc """
  Configuration for a `WorkerPool`. Cloud Build owns and maintains a pool of workers for general use and have no access to a project's private network. By default, builds submitted to Cloud Build will use a worker from this pool. If your build needs access to resources on a private network, create and use a `WorkerPool` to run your builds. Private `WorkerPool`s give your builds access to any single VPC network that you administer, including any on-prem resources connected to that VPC network. For an overview of private pools, see [Private pools overview](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/private-pools/private-pools-overview).

  ## Attributes

  *   `annotations` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - User specified annotations. See https://google.aip.dev/128#annotations for more details such as format and size limitations.
  *   `createTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. Time at which the request to create the `WorkerPool` was received.
  *   `deleteTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. Time at which the request to delete the `WorkerPool` was received.
  *   `displayName` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A user-specified, human-readable name for the `WorkerPool`. If provided, this value must be 1-63 characters.
  *   `etag` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. Checksum computed by the server. May be sent on update and delete requests to ensure that the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The resource name of the `WorkerPool`, with format `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workerPools/{worker_pool}`. The value of `{worker_pool}` is provided by `worker_pool_id` in `CreateWorkerPool` request and the value of `{location}` is determined by the endpoint accessed.
  *   `privatePoolV1Config` (*type:* `GoogleApi.CloudBuild.V1.Model.PrivatePoolV1Config.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Private Pool using a v1 configuration.
  *   `state` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. `WorkerPool` state.
  *   `uid` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. A unique identifier for the `WorkerPool`.
  *   `updateTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. Time at which the request to update the `WorkerPool` was received.
