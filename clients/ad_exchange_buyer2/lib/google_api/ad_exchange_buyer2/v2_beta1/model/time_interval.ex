defmodule GoogleApi.AdExchangeBuyer2.V2BETA1.Model.TimeInterval do
  @moduledoc """
  An interval of time, with an absolute start and end. This is included in the response, for several reasons: 1) The request may have specified start or end times relative to the time the    request was sent; the response indicates the corresponding absolute time    interval. 2) The request may have specified an end time past the latest time for which    data was available (e.g. if requesting data for the today); the response    indicates the latest time for which data was actually returned. 3) The response data for a single request may be broken down into multiple    time intervals, if a time series was requested.
