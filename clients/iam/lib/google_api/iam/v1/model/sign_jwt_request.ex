  The service account sign JWT request.

  ## Attributes

  *   `payload` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The JWT payload to sign. Must be a serialized JSON object that contains a
      JWT Claims Set. For example: `{"sub": "user@example.com", "iat": 313435}`

      If the JWT Claims Set contains an expiration time (`exp`) claim, it must be
      an integer timestamp that is not in the past and no more than 1 hour in the
      future.

      If the JWT Claims Set does not contain an expiration time (`exp`) claim,
      this claim is added automatically, with a timestamp that is 1 hour in the
      future.
