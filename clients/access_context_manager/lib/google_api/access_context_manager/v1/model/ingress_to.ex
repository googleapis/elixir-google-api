defmodule GoogleApi.AccessContextManager.V1.Model.IngressTo do
  @moduledoc """
  Defines the conditions under which an IngressPolicy matches a request. Conditions are based on information about the ApiOperation intended to be performed on the target resource of the request. The request must satisfy what is defined in `operations` AND `resources` in order to match.

  ## Attributes

  *   `operations` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.AccessContextManager.V1.Model.ApiOperation.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - A list of ApiOperations allowed to be performed by the sources specified in corresponding IngressFrom in this ServicePerimeter.
  *   `resources` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - A list of resources, currently only projects in the form `projects/`, protected by this ServicePerimeter that are allowed to be accessed by sources defined in the corresponding IngressFrom. If a single `*` is specified, then access to all resources inside the perimeter are allowed.
