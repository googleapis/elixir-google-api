defmodule GoogleApi.AccessContextManager.V1.Model.AccessPolicy do
  @moduledoc """
  `AccessPolicy` is a container for `AccessLevels` (which define the necessary attributes to use Google Cloud services) and `ServicePerimeters` (which define regions of services able to freely pass data within a perimeter). An access policy is globally visible within an organization, and the restrictions it specifies apply to all projects within an organization.

  ## Attributes

  *   `etag` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. An opaque identifier for the current version of the `AccessPolicy`. This will always be a strongly validated etag, meaning that two Access Policies will be identical if and only if their etags are identical. Clients should not expect this to be in any specific format.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. Identifier. Resource name of the `AccessPolicy`. Format: `accessPolicies/{access_policy}`
  *   `parent` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The parent of this `AccessPolicy` in the Cloud Resource Hierarchy. Currently immutable once created. Format: `organizations/{organization_id}`
  *   `scopes` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The scopes of the AccessPolicy. Scopes define which resources a policy can restrict and where its resources can be referenced. For example, policy A with `scopes=["folders/123"]` has the following behavior: - ServicePerimeter can only restrict projects within `folders/123`. - ServicePerimeter within policy A can only reference access levels defined within policy A. - Only one policy can include a given scope; thus, attempting to create a second policy which includes `folders/123` will result in an error. If no scopes are provided, then any resource within the organization can be restricted. Scopes cannot be modified after a policy is created. Policies can only have a single scope. Format: list of `folders/{folder_number}` or `projects/{project_number}`
  *   `title` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. Human readable title. Does not affect behavior.
