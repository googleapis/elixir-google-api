defmodule GoogleApi.DFAReporting.V28.Model.DynamicTargetingKey do
  @moduledoc """
  Contains properties of a dynamic targeting key. Dynamic targeting keys are unique, user-friendly labels, created at the advertiser level in DCM, that can be assigned to ads, creatives, and placements and used for targeting with DoubleClick Studio dynamic creatives. Use these labels instead of numeric DCM IDs (such as placement IDs) to save time and avoid errors in your dynamic feeds.
