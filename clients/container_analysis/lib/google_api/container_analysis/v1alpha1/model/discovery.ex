defmodule GoogleApi.ContainerAnalysis.V1alpha1.Model.Discovery do

  A note that indicates a type of analysis a provider would perform. This note
  exists in a provider's project. A `Discovery` occurrence is created in a
  consumer's project at the start of analysis. The occurrence's operation will
  indicate the status of the analysis. Absence of an occurrence linked to this
  note for a resource indicates that analysis hasn't started.

  ## Attributes

  *   `analysisKind` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The kind of analysis that is handled by this discovery.
