  A `SiteConfig` contains metadata associated with a specific site that
  controls Firebase Hosting serving behavior

  ## Attributes

  *   `cloudLoggingEnabled` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Whether or not web requests made by site visitors are logged via Cloud
      Logging.
  *   `maxVersions` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The number of FINALIZED versions that will be held for a site before
      automatic deletion. When a new version is deployed, content for versions
      in storage in excess of this number will be deleted, and will no longer be
      billed for storage usage. Oldest versions will be deleted first; sites are
      created with an unlimited number of max_versions by default.
