defmodule GoogleApi.StreetViewPublish.V1.Model.Pose do
  @moduledoc """
  Raw pose measurement for an entity.

  ## Attributes

  - accuracyMeters (float()): The estimated horizontal accuracy of this pose in meters with 68% confidence (one standard deviation). For example, on Android, this value is available from this method: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Location#getAccuracy(). Other platforms have different methods of obtaining similar accuracy estimations. Defaults to: `null`.
  - altitude (float()): Altitude of the pose in meters above WGS84 ellipsoid. NaN indicates an unmeasured quantity. Defaults to: `null`.
  - heading (float()): Compass heading, measured at the center of the photo in degrees clockwise from North. Value must be &gt;&#x3D;0 and &lt;360. NaN indicates an unmeasured quantity. Defaults to: `null`.
  - latLngPair (LatLng): Latitude and longitude pair of the pose, as explained here: https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/reference/rest/Shared.Types/LatLng When creating a Photo, if the latitude and longitude pair are not provided, the geolocation from the exif header is used. A latitude and longitude pair not provided in the photo or exif header causes the photo process to fail. Defaults to: `null`.
  - level (Level): Level (the floor in a building) used to configure vertical navigation. Defaults to: `null`.
  - pitch (float()): Pitch, measured at the center of the photo in degrees. Value must be &gt;&#x3D;-90 and &lt;&#x3D; 90. A value of -90 means looking directly down, and a value of 90 means looking directly up. NaN indicates an unmeasured quantity. Defaults to: `null`.
  - roll (float()): Roll, measured in degrees. Value must be &gt;&#x3D; 0 and &lt;360. A value of 0 means level with the horizon. NaN indicates an unmeasured quantity. Defaults to: `null`.
