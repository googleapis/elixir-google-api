defmodule GoogleApi.BigQueryDataTransfer.V1.Model.TimeRange do
  @moduledoc """
  A specification for a time range, this will request transfer runs with
  run_time between start_time (inclusive) and end_time (exclusive).

  ## Attributes

  - endTime (DateTime.t): End time of the range of transfer runs. For example,
  `"2017-05-30T00:00:00+00:00"`. The end_time must not be in the future.
  Creates transfer runs where run_time is in the range betwen start_time
  (inclusive) and end_time (exlusive). Defaults to `nil`.
  - startTime (DateTime.t): Start time of the range of transfer runs. For example,
  `"2017-05-25T00:00:00+00:00"`. The start_time must be strictly less than
  the end_time. Creates transfer runs where run_time is in the range betwen
  start_time (inclusive) and end_time (exlusive). Defaults to `nil`.
