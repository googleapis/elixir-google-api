defmodule GoogleApi.BigQueryDataTransfer.V1.Model.TimeBasedSchedule do
  @moduledoc """
  Options customizing the time based transfer schedule. Options are migrated from the original ScheduleOptions message.

  ## Attributes

  *   `endTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Defines time to stop scheduling transfer runs. A transfer run cannot be scheduled at or after the end time. The end time can be changed at any moment.
  *   `schedule` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Data transfer schedule. If the data source does not support a custom schedule, this should be empty. If it is empty, the default value for the data source will be used. The specified times are in UTC. Examples of valid format: `1st,3rd monday of month 15:30`, `every wed,fri of jan,jun 13:15`, and `first sunday of quarter 00:00`. See more explanation about the format here: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/scheduling-jobs-with-cron-yaml#the_schedule_format NOTE: The minimum interval time between recurring transfers depends on the data source; refer to the documentation for your data source.
  *   `startTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Specifies time to start scheduling transfer runs. The first run will be scheduled at or after the start time according to a recurrence pattern defined in the schedule string. The start time can be changed at any moment.
