  ## Attributes

  *   `agentIds` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - For character alarm, the media resources are provided through AOG apps. During alarm trigger phase, aog apps with the specified agent_ids are used to get the media resources. Multiple "AoG agents" can satisfy a character_tag. So the user will select the agents they want at alarm creation time. The chosen agents will be recorded so that the resources only from those agents will be used at trigger time. The number of selected agent_ids will not exceed 3. See go/character-alarm-aog.
  *   `characterTags` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The Character Alarm tag. Tags are needed to identify the theme of the alarm. For example, if the tag is 'astronaut', astronaut based audio is played during alarm ring. Note : We have made it repeated so that the user can choose multiple character alarm themes at one go. At present, the user is allowed to choose only one theme during alarm creation.
  *   `iconUrls` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Icons urls corresponding to a character. Note : We have made it repeated so that we can show different images when the alarm rings. At present, we only support only one image.
