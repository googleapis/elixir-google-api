defmodule GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreTollClusterProto do
  @moduledoc """
  A collection of information that applies to a toll cluster.

  ## Attributes

  *   `intersection` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreFeatureIdProto.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The list of TYPE_INTERSECTION features that are toll points and form this toll cluster. A toll cluster can consist of either a single or a group of intersection points called toll points at the end of various road segments in MapFacts that represent one or more lanes passing through a toll fixture that all go to the same routing destination. This relationship is reciprocal, as a toll point intersection also stores a reference to the toll cluster it belongs to. A toll cluster must have reference to one or more toll points i.e. toll_cluster.intersection should always be populated.
