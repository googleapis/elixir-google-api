defmodule GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.NlpSemanticParsingModelsMediaDeeplinkInfo do
  @moduledoc """
  Provider deeplink and associated metadata, in particular restrictions on platform and user's subscription. Next ID: 18

  ## Attributes

  *   `actionType` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The type of the deeplink. Sometimes the deeplink is not only used for playing media, but also used for other actions. For example, the deeplink could be for playing a movie trailer from YouTube or recording a movie from YouTube TV.
  *   `blacklistedCountry` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The upper-case, III country code, e.g., "US", in which the deeplink cannot play. For possible values, see: google3/i18n/identifiers/regioncode.h google3/java/com/google/i18n/identifiers/RegionCode.java For details on converting to and from ISO country codes, see http://iii-howto#GettingCanonRegionCodes.
  *   `country` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The upper-case, III country code, e.g., "US", in which the deeplink can play. If unset or has "earth" (b/72566951), means the deeplink can be used world-wide except in |blacklisted_country| list. For possible values, see: google3/i18n/identifiers/regioncode.h google3/java/com/google/i18n/identifiers/RegionCode.java For details on converting to and from ISO country codes, see http://iii-howto#GettingCanonRegionCodes.
  *   `deeplink` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Deeplink to the media. This deeplink is meant to be send to the provider app on available platforms without any modifications. Required.
  *   `deeplinkForExecution` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Some providers give us an opaque, unstable deeplink to use at execution-time. E.g. see http://go/collab-ranking-nl-uri#heading=h.ndmdfw388tk3 Such a deeplink is not useful for logging, caching, comparing to other candidate deeplinks, etc. So most fulfillment code will want the traditional, stable deeplink that can be interpreted, parsed, cached, etc (found in the "deeplink" field, above). But this opaque, unstable deeplink (if non-empty) must be included in the music initiation clientop.
  *   `incompatibleWithCredentials` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Indicate whether the deeplink is compatible with credentials. If true, CCS will not send the credentials to cast app. Currently this field is only used for voice-follow on cases on smart displays.
  *   `offer` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - List of offers that allow user to access the deeplink, that is if the list contains PREMIUM_SUBSCRIPTION and BASIC_SUBSCRIPTION users that have either premium or basic subscription can use the deeplink. If the list is empty it means that there are no subscription restrictions.
  *   `paidOfferDetail` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.NlpSemanticParsingModelsMediaPaidOfferDetail.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - This field is only used when "offer" includes a PAY_PER_USE. When "offer" includes a PAY_PER_USE, paid_offer_detail will contain offers for BUY and RENT offer_types with associated cost info.
  *   `platform` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - List of platforms that support the deeplink. If the list is empty it means that there are no platform restrictions.
  *   `score` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Document scores which are used for ranking action links. Document scores might come from CDOC in Raffia or other indexing systems. For example, for web pages, the score shows how likely the web page (composite doc) which generated this link refers to the given entity or how close a particular entity is with the given composite doc. For the larger design, please see go/ma_dedup. For PACIFIC_COLLAB_RANKING deeplink, the score is the normalized confidence score returned by partner for fulfillment candidate. For pivot candidates, the score is calculated with the index of the alternative results.
  *   `subscriptionPackageName` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Name of subscription packages which are granted access to this deeplink. This is to match exactly the end users authentication system. This is to be used if the offer is BASIC_SUBSCRIPTION or PREMIUM_SUBSCRIPTION. There can be multiple packages -- the user needs only to authenticate with a single package. For more information please see: go/subscription-package
  *   `tag` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Tags associated with the content played by this deeplink. In the common case, the deeplink is supposed to specify a music entity within the provider's inventory, and the provider app should decide the actual content based on the user's account profile (e.g., for a deeplink to an artist, playing tracks from the artist or similar artists, and for a song, playing the official album recording of the song). But in some cases, the deeplink belong to special content. For example, for an artist a seed radio based on the artist, and a live or karaoke version of a song. We use this field to mark such special content types.
  *   `validTimeWindow` (*type:* `GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.NlpSemanticParsingModelsMediaDeeplinkInfoTimeWindow.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A time window in which the deeplink is valid. If not set, the deeplink is considered valid.
  *   `vuiId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - DEPRECATED: This field is ignored by understanding and fulfillment.
  *   `youtubeDeeplinkInfo` (*type:* `GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.NlpSemanticParsingModelsMediaYouTubeDeeplinkInfo.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Additional info specific to YouTube Deeplink (if applicable).
