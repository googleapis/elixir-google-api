defmodule GoogleApi.ProximityBeacon.V1beta1.Model.Beacon do
  @moduledoc """
  Details of a beacon device.

  ## Attributes

  - advertisedId (GoogleApi.ProximityBeacon.V1beta1.Model.AdvertisedId.t): The identifier of a beacon as advertised by it. This field must be
  populated when registering. It may be empty when updating a beacon
  record because it is ignored in updates.

  When registering a beacon that broadcasts Eddystone-EID, this field
  should contain a "stable" Eddystone-UID that identifies the beacon and
  links it to its attachments. The stable Eddystone-UID is only used for
  administering the beacon. Defaults to `nil`.
  - beaconName (String.t): Resource name of this beacon. A beacon name has the format
  "beacons/N!beaconId" where the beaconId is the base16 ID broadcast by
  the beacon and N is a code for the beacon's type. Possible values are
  `3` for Eddystone, `1` for iBeacon, or `5` for AltBeacon.

  This field must be left empty when registering. After reading a beacon,
  clients can use the name for future operations. Defaults to `nil`.
  - description (String.t): Free text used to identify and describe the beacon. Maximum length 140
  characters.
  Optional. Defaults to `nil`.
  - ephemeralIdRegistration (GoogleApi.ProximityBeacon.V1beta1.Model.EphemeralIdRegistration.t): Write-only registration parameters for beacons using Eddystone-EID
  (remotely resolved ephemeral ID) format. This information will not be
  populated in API responses. When submitting this data, the `advertised_id`
  field must contain an ID of type Eddystone-UID. Any other ID type will
  result in an error. Defaults to `nil`.
  - expectedStability (String.t): Expected location stability. This is set when the beacon is registered or
  updated, not automatically detected in any way.
  Optional. Defaults to `nil`.
  - indoorLevel (GoogleApi.ProximityBeacon.V1beta1.Model.IndoorLevel.t): The indoor level information for this beacon, if known. As returned by the
  Google Maps API.
  Optional. Defaults to `nil`.
  - latLng (GoogleApi.ProximityBeacon.V1beta1.Model.LatLng.t): The location of the beacon, expressed as a latitude and longitude pair.
  This location is given when the beacon is registered or updated. It does
  not necessarily indicate the actual current location of the beacon.
  Optional. Defaults to `nil`.
  - placeId (String.t): The [Google Places API](/places/place-id) Place ID of the place where
  the beacon is deployed. This is given when the beacon is registered or
  updated, not automatically detected in any way.
  Optional. Defaults to `nil`.
  - properties (map()): Properties of the beacon device, for example battery type or firmware
  version.
  Optional. Defaults to `nil`.
  - provisioningKey (String.t): Some beacons may require a user to provide an authorization key before
  changing any of its configuration (e.g. broadcast frames, transmit power).
  This field provides a place to store and control access to that key.
  This field is populated in responses to `GET /v1beta1/beacons/3!beaconId`
  from users with write access to the given beacon. That is to say: If the
  user is authorized to write the beacon's confidential data in the service,
  the service considers them authorized to configure the beacon. Note
  that this key grants nothing on the service, only on the beacon itself. Defaults to `nil`.
  - status (String.t): Current status of the beacon.
  Required. Defaults to `nil`.
