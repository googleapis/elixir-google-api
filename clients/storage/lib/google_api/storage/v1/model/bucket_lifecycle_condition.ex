  @moduledoc """
  The condition(s) under which the action will be taken.

  ## Attributes

  - age (integer()): Age of an object (in days). This condition is satisfied when an object reaches the specified age. Defaults to: `null`.
  - createdBefore (Date.t): A date in RFC 3339 format with only the date part (for instance, \&quot;2013-01-15\&quot;). This condition is satisfied when an object is created before midnight of the specified date in UTC. Defaults to: `null`.
  - isLive (boolean()): Relevant only for versioned objects. If the value is true, this condition matches live objects; if the value is false, it matches archived objects. Defaults to: `null`.
  - matchesStorageClass ([String.t]): Objects having any of the storage classes specified by this condition will be matched. Values include MULTI_REGIONAL, REGIONAL, NEARLINE, COLDLINE, STANDARD, and DURABLE_REDUCED_AVAILABILITY. Defaults to: `null`.
  - numNewerVersions (integer()): Relevant only for versioned objects. If the value is N, this condition is satisfied when there are at least N versions (including the live version) newer than this version of the object. Defaults to: `null`.
