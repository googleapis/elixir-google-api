defmodule GoogleApi.Storage.V1.Model.Expr do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents an expression text. Example: title: \&quot;User account presence\&quot; description: \&quot;Determines whether the request has a user account\&quot; expression: \&quot;size(request.user) &gt; 0\&quot;

  ## Attributes

  - description (String.t): An optional description of the expression. This is a longer text which describes the expression, e.g. when hovered over it in a UI. Defaults to: `null`.
  - expression (String.t): Textual representation of an expression in Common Expression Language syntax. The application context of the containing message determines which well-known feature set of CEL is supported. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String.t): The kind of item this is. For storage, this is always storage#expr. This field is ignored on input. Defaults to: `null`.
  - location (String.t): An optional string indicating the location of the expression for error reporting, e.g. a file name and a position in the file. Defaults to: `null`.
  - title (String.t): An optional title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing its purpose. This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the expression. Defaults to: `null`.
