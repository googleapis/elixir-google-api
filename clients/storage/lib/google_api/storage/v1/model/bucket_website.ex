defmodule GoogleApi.Storage.V1.Model.BucketWebsite do
  @moduledoc """
  The bucket's website configuration, controlling how the service behaves when accessing bucket contents as a web site. See the Static Website Examples for more information.

  ## Attributes

  *   `mainPageSuffix` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - If the requested object path is missing, the service will ensure the path has a trailing '/', append this suffix, and attempt to retrieve the resulting object. This allows the creation of index.html objects to represent directory pages.
  *   `notFoundPage` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - If the requested object path is missing, and any mainPageSuffix object is missing, if applicable, the service will return the named object from this bucket as the content for a 404 Not Found result.
