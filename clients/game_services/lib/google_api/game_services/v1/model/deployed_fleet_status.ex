  *   `readyReplicas` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The number of GameServer replicas in the READY state in this fleet.
  *   `replicas` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The total number of current GameServer replicas in this fleet.
  *   `reservedReplicas` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The number of GameServer replicas in the RESERVED state in this fleet. Reserved instances won't be deleted on scale down, but won't cause an autoscaler to scale up.
