defmodule GoogleApi.CloudDebugger.V2.Model.Debuggee do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents the debugged application. The application may include one or more replicated processes executing the same code. Each of these processes is attached with a debugger agent, carrying out the debugging commands. Agents attached to the same debuggee identify themselves as such by using exactly the same Debuggee message value when registering.

  ## Attributes

  - agentVersion (String.t): Version ID of the agent. Schema: &#x60;domain/language-platform/vmajor.minor&#x60; (for example &#x60;google.com/java-gcp/v1.1&#x60;). Defaults to: `null`.
  - description (String.t): Human readable description of the debuggee. Including a human-readable project name, environment name and version information is recommended. Defaults to: `null`.
  - extSourceContexts ([ExtendedSourceContext]): References to the locations and revisions of the source code used in the deployed application. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String.t): Unique identifier for the debuggee generated by the controller service. Defaults to: `null`.
  - isDisabled (boolean()): If set to &#x60;true&#x60;, indicates that the agent should disable itself and detach from the debuggee. Defaults to: `null`.
  - isInactive (boolean()): If set to &#x60;true&#x60;, indicates that Controller service does not detect any activity from the debuggee agents and the application is possibly stopped. Defaults to: `null`.
  - labels (%{optional(String.t) &#x3D;&gt; String.t}): A set of custom debuggee properties, populated by the agent, to be displayed to the user. Defaults to: `null`.
  - project (String.t): Project the debuggee is associated with. Use project number or id when registering a Google Cloud Platform project. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sourceContexts ([SourceContext]): References to the locations and revisions of the source code used in the deployed application. Defaults to: `null`.
  - status (StatusMessage): Human readable message to be displayed to the user about this debuggee. Absence of this field indicates no status. The message can be either informational or an error status. Defaults to: `null`.
  - uniquifier (String.t): Uniquifier to further distiguish the application. It is possible that different applications might have identical values in the debuggee message, thus, incorrectly identified as a single application by the Controller service. This field adds salt to further distiguish the application. Agents should consider seeding this field with value that identifies the code, binary, configuration and environment. Defaults to: `null`.
