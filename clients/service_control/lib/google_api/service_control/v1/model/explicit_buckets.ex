  @moduledoc """
  Describing buckets with arbitrary user-provided width.

  ## Attributes

  - bounds (list(float())): 'bound' is a list of strictly increasing boundaries between
  buckets. Note that a list of length N-1 defines N buckets because
  of fenceposting. See comments on `bucket_options` for details.

  The i'th finite bucket covers the interval
  [bound[i-1], bound[i])
  where i ranges from 1 to bound_size() - 1. Note that there are no
  finite buckets at all if 'bound' only contains a single element; in
  that special case the single bound defines the boundary between the
  underflow and overflow buckets.

  bucket number                   lower bound    upper bound
  i == 0 (underflow)              -inf           bound[i]

  i == bound_size() (overflow)    bound[i-1]     +inf Defaults to `nil`.
