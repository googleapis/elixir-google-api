defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceControl.V1.Model.Resource do

  This message defines core attributes for a resource. A resource is an
  addressable (named) entity provided by the destination service. For
  example, a file stored on a network storage service.

  ## Attributes

  *   `labels` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - The labels or tags on the resource, such as AWS resource tags and
      Kubernetes resource labels.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The stable identifier (name) of a resource on the `service`. A resource
      can be logically identified as "//{resource.service}/{resource.name}".
      The differences between a resource name and a URI are:

      *   Resource name is a logical identifier, independent of network
          protocol and API version. For example,
          `//pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/123/topics/news-feed`.
      *   URI often includes protocol and version information, so it can
          be used directly by applications. For example,
          `https://pubsub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/123/topics/news-feed`.

      See https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names for details.
  *   `service` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The name of the service that this resource belongs to, such as
      `pubsub.googleapis.com`. The service may be different from the DNS
      hostname that actually serves the request.
  *   `type` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The type of the resource. The scheme is platform-specific because
      different platforms define their resources differently.
