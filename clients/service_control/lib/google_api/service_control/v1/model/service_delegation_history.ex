defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceControl.V1.Model.ServiceDelegationHistory do
  @moduledoc """
  The history of delegation across multiple services as the result of the original user's action. Such as "service A uses its own account to do something for user B". This differs from ServiceAccountDelegationInfo, which only tracks the history of direct token exchanges (impersonation).

  ## Attributes

  *   `originalPrincipal` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The original end user who initiated the request to GCP.
  *   `serviceMetadata` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.ServiceControl.V1.Model.ServiceMetadata.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Data identifying the service specific jobs or units of work that were involved in a chain of service calls.
