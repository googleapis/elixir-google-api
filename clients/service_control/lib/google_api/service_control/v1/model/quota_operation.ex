defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceControl.V1.Model.QuotaOperation do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents information regarding a quota operation.

  ## Attributes

  - consumerId (String.t): Identity of the consumer for whom this quota operation is being performed.

  This can be in one of the following formats:
  project:<project_id>,
  project_number:<project_number>,
  api_key:<api_key>. Defaults to `nil`.
  - labels (map()): Labels describing the operation. Defaults to `nil`.
  - methodName (String.t): Fully qualified name of the API method for which this quota operation is
  requested. This name is used for matching quota rules or metric rules and
  billing status rules defined in service configuration.

  This field should not be set if any of the following is true:
  (1) the quota operation is performed on non-API resources.
  (2) quota_metrics is set because the caller is doing quota override.

  Example of an RPC method name:
    google.example.library.v1.LibraryService.CreateShelf Defaults to `nil`.
  - operationId (String.t): Identity of the operation. This is expected to be unique within the scope
  of the service that generated the operation, and guarantees idempotency in
  case of retries.

  UUID version 4 is recommended, though not required. In scenarios where an
  operation is computed from existing information and an idempotent id is
  desirable for deduplication purpose, UUID version 5 is recommended. See
  RFC 4122 for details. Defaults to `nil`.
  - quotaMetrics (list(GoogleApi.ServiceControl.V1.Model.MetricValueSet.t)): Represents information about this operation. Each MetricValueSet
  corresponds to a metric defined in the service configuration.
  The data type used in the MetricValueSet must agree with
  the data type specified in the metric definition.

  Within a single operation, it is not allowed to have more than one
  MetricValue instances that have the same metric names and identical
  label value combinations. If a request has such duplicated MetricValue
  instances, the entire request is rejected with
  an invalid argument error.

  This field is mutually exclusive with method_name. Defaults to `nil`.
  - quotaMode (String.t): Quota mode for this operation. Defaults to `nil`.
