defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceControl.V1.Model.ResourceLocation do
  @moduledoc """
  Location information about a resource.

  ## Attributes

  *   `currentLocations` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The locations of a resource after the execution of the operation.
      Requests to create or delete a location based resource must populate
      the 'current_locations' field and not the 'original_locations' field.
      For example:

          "europe-west1-a"
          "us-east1"
          "nam3"
  *   `originalLocations` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The locations of a resource prior to the execution of the operation.
      Requests that mutate the resource's location must populate both the
      'original_locations' as well as the 'current_locations' fields.
      For example:

          "europe-west1-a"
          "us-east1"
          "nam3"
