defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceControl.V1.Model.AuthenticationInfo do
  @moduledoc """
  Authentication information for the operation.

  ## Attributes

  - authoritySelector (String.t): The authority selector specified by the requestor, if any.
  It is not guaranteed that the principal was allowed to use this authority. Defaults to `nil`.
  - principalEmail (String.t): The email address of the authenticated user (or service account on behalf
  of third party principal) making the request. For privacy reasons, the
  principal email address is redacted for all read-only operations that fail
  with a "permission denied" error. Defaults to `nil`.
  - serviceAccountDelegationInfo (list(GoogleApi.ServiceControl.V1.Model.ServiceAccountDelegationInfo.t)): Identity delegation history of an authenticated service account that makes
  the request. It contains information on the real authorities that try to
  access GCP resources by delegating on a service account. When multiple
  authorities present, they are guaranteed to be sorted based on the original
  ordering of the identity delegation events. Defaults to `nil`.
  - serviceAccountKeyName (String.t): The name of the service account key used to create or exchange
  credentials for authenticating the service account making the request.
  This is a scheme-less URI full resource name. For example:

  "//iam.googleapis.com/projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}/keys/{key}" Defaults to `nil`.
  - thirdPartyPrincipal (map()): The third party identification (if any) of the authenticated user making
  the request.
  When the JSON object represented here has a proto equivalent, the proto
  name will be indicated in the `@type` property. Defaults to `nil`.
