defmodule GoogleApi.CloudTasks.V2.Model.HttpRequest do

  HTTP request.

  The task will be pushed to the worker as an HTTP request. If the worker
  or the redirected worker acknowledges the task by returning a successful HTTP
  response code ([`200` - `299`]), the task will removed from the queue. If
  any other HTTP response code is returned or no response is received, the
  task will be retried according to the following:

  * User-specified throttling: retry configuration,
    rate limits, and the queue's state.

  * System throttling: To prevent the worker from overloading, Cloud Tasks may
    temporarily reduce the queue's effective rate. User-specified settings
    will not be changed.

   System throttling happens because:

    * Cloud Tasks backs off on all errors. Normally the backoff specified in
      rate limits will be used. But if the worker returns
      `429` (Too Many Requests), `503` (Service Unavailable), or the rate of
      errors is high, Cloud Tasks will use a higher backoff rate. The retry
      specified in the `Retry-After` HTTP response header is considered.

    * To prevent traffic spikes and to smooth sudden large traffic spikes,
      dispatches ramp up slowly when the queue is newly created or idle and
      if large numbers of tasks suddenly become available to dispatch (due to
      spikes in create task rates, the queue being unpaused, or many tasks
      that are scheduled at the same time).

  ## Attributes

  *   `body` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - HTTP request body.

      A request body is allowed only if the
      HTTP method is POST, PUT, or PATCH. It is an
      error to set body on a task with an incompatible HttpMethod.
  *   `headers` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - HTTP request headers.

      This map contains the header field names and values.
      Headers can be set when the
      task is created.

      These headers represent a subset of the headers that will accompany the
      task's HTTP request. Some HTTP request headers will be ignored or replaced.

      A partial list of headers that will be ignored or replaced is:

      * Host: This will be computed by Cloud Tasks and derived from
        HttpRequest.url.
      * Content-Length: This will be computed by Cloud Tasks.
      * User-Agent: This will be set to `"Google-Cloud-Tasks"`.
      * X-Google-*: Google use only.
      * X-AppEngine-*: Google use only.

      `Content-Type` won't be set by Cloud Tasks. You can explicitly set
      `Content-Type` to a media type when the
       task is created.
       For example, `Content-Type` can be set to `"application/octet-stream"` or
       `"application/json"`.

      Headers which can have multiple values (according to RFC2616) can be
      specified using comma-separated values.

      The size of the headers must be less than 80KB.
  *   `httpMethod` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The HTTP method to use for the request. The default is POST.
  *   `oauthToken` (*type:* `GoogleApi.CloudTasks.V2.Model.OAuthToken.t`, *default:* `nil`) - If specified, an
      [OAuth token](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2)
      will be generated and attached as an `Authorization` header in the HTTP
      request.

      This type of authorization should generally only be used when calling
      Google APIs hosted on *.googleapis.com.
  *   `oidcToken` (*type:* `GoogleApi.CloudTasks.V2.Model.OidcToken.t`, *default:* `nil`) - If specified, an
      [OIDC](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect)
      token will be generated and attached as an `Authorization` header in the
      HTTP request.

      This type of authorization can be used for many scenarios, including
      calling Cloud Run, or endpoints where you intend to validate the token
      yourself.
  *   `url` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The full url path that the request will be sent to.

      This string must begin with either "http://" or "https://". Some examples
      are: `http://acme.com` and `https://acme.com/sales:8080`. Cloud Tasks will
      encode some characters for safety and compatibility. The maximum allowed
      URL length is 2083 characters after encoding.

      The `Location` header response from a redirect response [`300` - `399`]
      may be followed. The redirect is not counted as a separate attempt.
