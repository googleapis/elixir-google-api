defmodule GoogleApi.CloudTasks.V2beta2.Model.Queue do
  @moduledoc """
  A queue is a container of related tasks. Queues are configured to manage
  how those tasks are dispatched. Configurable properties include rate limits,
  retry options, target types, and others.

  ## Attributes

  - appEngineHttpTarget (GoogleApi.CloudTasks.V2beta2.Model.AppEngineHttpTarget.t): App Engine HTTP target.

  An App Engine queue is a queue that has an AppEngineHttpTarget. Defaults to `nil`.
  - name (String.t): Caller-specified and required in CreateQueue,
  after which it becomes output only.

  The queue name.

  The queue name must have the following format:
  `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID`

  * `PROJECT_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]),
   hyphens (-), colons (:), or periods (.).
   For more information, see
   [Identifying
   projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects)
  * `LOCATION_ID` is the canonical ID for the queue's location.
   The list of available locations can be obtained by calling
   ListLocations.
   For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/.
  * `QUEUE_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), or
  hyphens (-). The maximum length is 100 characters. Defaults to `nil`.
  - pullTarget (GoogleApi.CloudTasks.V2beta2.Model.PullTarget.t): Pull target.

  A pull queue is a queue that has a PullTarget. Defaults to `nil`.
  - purgeTime (DateTime.t): Output only. The last time this queue was purged.

  All tasks that were created before this time
  were purged.

  A queue can be purged using PurgeQueue, the
  [App Engine Task Queue SDK, or the Cloud
  Console](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/taskqueue/push/deleting-tasks-and-queues#purging_all_tasks_from_a_queue).

  Purge time will be truncated to the nearest microsecond. Purge
  time will be unset if the queue has never been purged. Defaults to `nil`.
  - rateLimits (GoogleApi.CloudTasks.V2beta2.Model.RateLimits.t): Rate limits for task dispatches.

  rate_limits and
  retry_config are related because they both
  control task attempts however they control how tasks are
  attempted in different ways:

  * rate_limits controls the total rate of
  dispatches from a queue (i.e. all traffic dispatched from the
  queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is from a first
  attempt or a retry).
  * retry_config controls what happens to
  particular a task after its first attempt fails. That is,
  retry_config controls task retries (the
  second attempt, third attempt, etc). Defaults to `nil`.
  - retryConfig (GoogleApi.CloudTasks.V2beta2.Model.RetryConfig.t): Settings that determine the retry behavior.

  * For tasks created using Cloud Tasks: the queue-level retry settings
  apply to all tasks in the queue that were created using Cloud Tasks.
  Retry settings cannot be set on individual tasks.
  * For tasks created using the App Engine SDK: the queue-level retry
  settings apply to all tasks in the queue which do not have retry settings
  explicitly set on the task and were created by the App Engine SDK. See
  [App Engine
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/taskqueue/push/retrying-tasks). Defaults to `nil`.
  - state (String.t): Output only. The state of the queue.

  `state` can only be changed by called
  PauseQueue,
  ResumeQueue, or uploading
  [queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/queueref).
  UpdateQueue cannot be used to change `state`. Defaults to `nil`.
