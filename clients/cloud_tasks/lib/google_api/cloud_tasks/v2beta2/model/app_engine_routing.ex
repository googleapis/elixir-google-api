  App Engine Routing.  Defines routing characteristics specific to App Engine - service, version, and instance.  For more information about services, versions, and instances see [An Overview of App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/an-overview-of-app-engine), [Microservices Architecture on Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/microservices-on-app-engine), [App Engine Standard request routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed), and [App Engine Flex request routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/how-requests-are-routed).

  ## Attributes

  - host (String.t): Output only. The host that the task is sent to.  For more information, see [How Requests are Routed](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed).  The host is constructed as:   * &#x60;host &#x3D; [application_domain_name]&#x60;&lt;/br&gt;   &#x60;| [service] + &#39;.&#39; + [application_domain_name]&#x60;&lt;/br&gt;   &#x60;| [version] + &#39;.&#39; + [application_domain_name]&#x60;&lt;/br&gt;   &#x60;| [version_dot_service]+ &#39;.&#39; + [application_domain_name]&#x60;&lt;/br&gt;   &#x60;| [instance] + &#39;.&#39; + [application_domain_name]&#x60;&lt;/br&gt;   &#x60;| [instance_dot_service] + &#39;.&#39; + [application_domain_name]&#x60;&lt;/br&gt;   &#x60;| [instance_dot_version] + &#39;.&#39; + [application_domain_name]&#x60;&lt;/br&gt;   &#x60;| [instance_dot_version_dot_service] + &#39;.&#39; + [application_domain_name]&#x60;  * &#x60;application_domain_name&#x60; &#x3D; The domain name of the app, for   example &lt;app-id&gt;.appspot.com, which is associated with the   queue&#39;s project ID. Some tasks which were created using the App Engine   SDK use a custom domain name.  * &#x60;service &#x3D;&#x60; service  * &#x60;version &#x3D;&#x60; version  * &#x60;version_dot_service &#x3D;&#x60;   version &#x60;+ &#39;.&#39; +&#x60;   service  * &#x60;instance &#x3D;&#x60; instance  * &#x60;instance_dot_service &#x3D;&#x60;   instance &#x60;+ &#39;.&#39; +&#x60;   service  * &#x60;instance_dot_version &#x3D;&#x60;   instance &#x60;+ &#39;.&#39; +&#x60;   version  * &#x60;instance_dot_version_dot_service &#x3D;&#x60;   instance &#x60;+ &#39;.&#39; +&#x60;   version &#x60;+ &#39;.&#39; +&#x60;   service  If service is empty, then the task will be sent to the service which is the default service when the task is attempted.  If version is empty, then the task will be sent to the version which is the default version when the task is attempted.  If instance is empty, then the task will be sent to an instance which is available when the task is attempted.  If service, version, or instance is invalid, then the task will be sent to the default version of the default service when the task is attempted. Defaults to: `null`.
  - instance (String.t): App instance.  By default, the task is sent to an instance which is available when the task is attempted.  Requests can only be sent to a specific instance if [manual scaling is used in App Engine Standard](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/an-overview-of-app-engine?hl&#x3D;en_US#scaling_types_and_instance_classes). App Engine Flex does not support instances. For more information, see [App Engine Standard request routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed) and [App Engine Flex request routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/how-requests-are-routed). Defaults to: `null`.
  - service (String.t): App service.  By default, the task is sent to the service which is the default service when the task is attempted.  For some queues or tasks which were created using the App Engine Task Queue API, host is not parsable into service, version, and instance. For example, some tasks which were created using the App Engine SDK use a custom domain name; custom domains are not parsed by Cloud Tasks. If host is not parsable, then service, version, and instance are the empty string. Defaults to: `null`.
  - version (String.t): App version.  By default, the task is sent to the version which is the default version when the task is attempted.  For some queues or tasks which were created using the App Engine Task Queue API, host is not parsable into service, version, and instance. For example, some tasks which were created using the App Engine SDK use a custom domain name; custom domains are not parsed by Cloud Tasks. If host is not parsable, then service, version, and instance are the empty string. Defaults to: `null`.
