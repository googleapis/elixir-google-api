  App Engine Routing.

  Defines routing characteristics specific to App Engine - service, version,
  and instance.

  For more information about services, versions, and instances see
  [An Overview of App
  Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/an-overview-of-app-engine),
  [Microservices Architecture on Google App
  Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/microservices-on-app-engine),
  [App Engine Standard request
  routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed),
  and [App Engine Flex request
  routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/how-requests-are-routed).

  ## Attributes

  - host (String.t): Output only. The host that the task is sent to.

  For more information, see
  [How Requests are
  Routed](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed).

  The host is constructed as:


  * `host = [application_domain_name]`</br>
  `| [service] + '.' + [application_domain_name]`</br>
  `| [version] + '.' + [application_domain_name]`</br>
  `| [version_dot_service]+ '.' + [application_domain_name]`</br>
  `| [instance] + '.' + [application_domain_name]`</br>
  `| [instance_dot_service] + '.' + [application_domain_name]`</br>
  `| [instance_dot_version] + '.' + [application_domain_name]`</br>
  `| [instance_dot_version_dot_service] + '.' + [application_domain_name]`

  * `application_domain_name` = The domain name of the app, for
  example <app-id>.appspot.com, which is associated with the
  queue's project ID. Some tasks which were created using the App Engine
  SDK use a custom domain name.

  * `service =` service

  * `version =` version

  * `version_dot_service =`
  version `+ '.' +`
  service

  * `instance =` instance

  * `instance_dot_service =`
  instance `+ '.' +`
  service

  * `instance_dot_version =`
  instance `+ '.' +`
  version

  * `instance_dot_version_dot_service =`
  instance `+ '.' +`
  version `+ '.' +`
  service

  If service is empty, then the task will be sent
  to the service which is the default service when the task is attempted.

  If version is empty, then the task will be sent
  to the version which is the default version when the task is attempted.

  If instance is empty, then the task
  will be sent to an instance which is available when the task is
  attempted.

  If service,
  version, or
  instance is invalid, then the task
  will be sent to the default version of the default service when
  the task is attempted. Defaults to `nil`.
  - instance (String.t): App instance.

  By default, the task is sent to an instance which is available when
  the task is attempted.

  Requests can only be sent to a specific instance if
  [manual scaling is used in App Engine
  Standard](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/an-overview-of-app-engine?hl=en_US#scaling_types_and_instance_classes).
  App Engine Flex does not support instances. For more information, see
  [App Engine Standard request
  routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed)
  and [App Engine Flex request
  routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/how-requests-are-routed). Defaults to `nil`.
  - service (String.t): App service.

  By default, the task is sent to the service which is the default
  service when the task is attempted.

  For some queues or tasks which were created using the App Engine
  Task Queue API, host is not parsable
  into service,
  version, and
  instance. For example, some tasks
  which were created using the App Engine SDK use a custom domain
  name; custom domains are not parsed by Cloud Tasks. If
  host is not parsable, then
  service,
  version, and
  instance are the empty string. Defaults to `nil`.
  - version (String.t): App version.

  By default, the task is sent to the version which is the default
  version when the task is attempted.

  For some queues or tasks which were created using the App Engine
  Task Queue API, host is not parsable
  into service,
  version, and
  instance. For example, some tasks
  which were created using the App Engine SDK use a custom domain
  name; custom domains are not parsed by Cloud Tasks. If
  host is not parsable, then
  service,
  version, and
  instance are the empty string. Defaults to `nil`.
