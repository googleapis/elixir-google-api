defmodule GoogleApi.CloudTasks.V2beta2.Model.AppEngineHttpRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  App Engine HTTP request.

  The message defines the HTTP request that is sent to an App Engine app when
  the task is dispatched.

  This proto can only be used for tasks in a queue which has
  app_engine_http_target set.

  Using AppEngineHttpRequest requires
  [`appengine.applications.get`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/access-control)
  Google IAM permission for the project
  and the following scope:

  `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`

  The task will be delivered to the App Engine app which belongs to the same
  project as the queue. For more information, see
  [How Requests are
  Routed](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed)
  and how routing is affected by
  [dispatch
  files](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/dispatchref).
  Traffic is encrypted during transport and never leaves Google datacenters.
  Because this traffic is carried over a communication mechanism internal to
  Google, you cannot explicitly set the protocol (for example, HTTP or HTTPS).
  The request to the handler, however, will appear to have used the HTTP
  protocol.

  The AppEngineRouting used to construct the URL that the task is
  delivered to can be set at the queue-level or task-level:

  * If set,
     app_engine_routing_override
     is used for all tasks in the queue, no matter what the setting
     is for the
     task-level app_engine_routing.


  The `url` that the task will be sent to is:

  * `url =` host `+`
    relative_url

  Tasks can be dispatched to secure app handlers, unsecure app handlers, and
  URIs restricted with
  [`login:
  admin`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref).
  Because tasks are not run as any user, they cannot be dispatched to URIs
  restricted with
  [`login:
  required`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref)
  Task dispatches also do not follow redirects.

  The task attempt has succeeded if the app's request handler returns an HTTP
  response code in the range [`200` - `299`]. The task attempt has failed if
  the app's handler returns a non-2xx response code or Cloud Tasks does
  not receive response before the deadline. Failed
  tasks will be retried according to the
  retry configuration. `503` (Service Unavailable) is
  considered an App Engine system error instead of an application error and
  will cause Cloud Tasks' traffic congestion control to temporarily throttle
  the queue's dispatches. Unlike other types of task targets, a `429` (Too Many
  Requests) response from an app handler does not cause traffic congestion
  control to throttle the queue.

  ## Attributes

  *   `appEngineRouting` (*type:* `GoogleApi.CloudTasks.V2beta2.Model.AppEngineRouting.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Task-level setting for App Engine routing.

      If set,
      app_engine_routing_override
      is used for all tasks in the queue, no matter what the setting is for the
      task-level app_engine_routing.
  *   `headers` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - HTTP request headers.

      This map contains the header field names and values.
      Headers can be set when the
      task is created.
      Repeated headers are not supported but a header value can contain commas.

      Cloud Tasks sets some headers to default values:

      * `User-Agent`: By default, this header is
        `"AppEngine-Google; (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"`.
        This header can be modified, but Cloud Tasks will append
        `"AppEngine-Google; (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"` to the
        modified `User-Agent`.

      If the task has a payload, Cloud
      Tasks sets the following headers:

      * `Content-Type`: By default, the `Content-Type` header is set to
        `"application/octet-stream"`. The default can be overridden by explicitly
        setting `Content-Type` to a particular media type when the
        task is created.
        For example, `Content-Type` can be set to `"application/json"`.
      * `Content-Length`: This is computed by Cloud Tasks. This value is
        output only.   It cannot be changed.

      The headers below cannot be set or overridden:

      * `Host`
      * `X-Google-*`
      * `X-AppEngine-*`

      In addition, Cloud Tasks sets some headers when the task is dispatched,
      such as headers containing information about the task; see
      [request
      headers](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/taskqueue/push/creating-handlers#reading_request_headers).
      These headers are set only when the task is dispatched, so they are not
      visible when the task is returned in a Cloud Tasks response.

      Although there is no specific limit for the maximum number of headers or
      the size, there is a limit on the maximum size of the Task. For more
      information, see the CreateTask documentation.
  *   `httpMethod` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The HTTP method to use for the request. The default is POST.

      The app's request handler for the task's target URL must be able to handle
      HTTP requests with this http_method, otherwise the task attempt will fail
      with error code 405 (Method Not Allowed). See
      [Writing a push task request
      handler](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/taskqueue/push/creating-handlers#writing_a_push_task_request_handler)
      and the documentation for the request handlers in the language your app is
      written in e.g.
      [Python Request
      Handler](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/webapp/requesthandlerclass).
  *   `payload` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Payload.

      The payload will be sent as the HTTP message body. A message
      body, and thus a payload, is allowed only if the HTTP method is
      POST or PUT. It is an error to set a data payload on a task with
      an incompatible HttpMethod.
  *   `relativeUrl` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The relative URL.

      The relative URL must begin with "/" and must be a valid HTTP relative URL.
      It can contain a path and query string arguments.
      If the relative URL is empty, then the root path "/" will be used.
      No spaces are allowed, and the maximum length allowed is 2083 characters.
