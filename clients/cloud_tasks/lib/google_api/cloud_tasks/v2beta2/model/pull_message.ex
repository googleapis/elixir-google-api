defmodule GoogleApi.CloudTasks.V2beta2.Model.PullMessage do
  @moduledoc """
  The pull message contains data that can be used by the caller of LeaseTasks to process the task.  This proto can only be used for tasks in a queue which has pull_target set.

  ## Attributes

  - payload (binary()): A data payload consumed by the worker to execute the task. Defaults to: `null`.
  - tag (String.t): The task&#39;s tag.  Tags allow similar tasks to be processed in a batch. If you label tasks with a tag, your worker can lease tasks with the same tag using filter. For example, if you want to aggregate the events associated with a specific user once a day, you could tag tasks with the user ID.  The task&#39;s tag can only be set when the task is created.  The tag must be less than 500 characters.  SDK compatibility: Although the SDK allows tags to be either string or [bytes](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/javadoc/com/google/appengine/api/taskqueue/TaskOptions.html#tag-byte:A-), only UTF-8 encoded tags can be used in Cloud Tasks. If a tag isn&#39;t UTF-8 encoded, the tag will be empty when the task is returned by Cloud Tasks. Defaults to: `null`.
