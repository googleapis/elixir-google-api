defmodule GoogleApi.CloudTasks.V2beta2.Model.CancelLeaseRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  Request message for canceling a lease using
  CancelLease.

  ## Attributes

  - responseView (String.t): The response_view specifies which subset of the Task will be
  returned.

  By default response_view is BASIC; not all
  information is retrieved by default because some data, such as
  payloads, might be desirable to return only when needed because
  of its large size or because of the sensitivity of data that it
  contains.

  Authorization for FULL requires
  `cloudtasks.tasks.fullView` [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/)
  permission on the Task resource. Defaults to `nil`.
  - scheduleTime (DateTime.t): Required.

  The task's current schedule time, available in the
  schedule_time returned by
  LeaseTasks response or
  RenewLease response. This restriction is
  to ensure that your worker currently holds the lease. Defaults to `nil`.
