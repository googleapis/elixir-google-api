defmodule GoogleApi.Run.V1.Model.Service do
  @moduledoc """
  Service acts as a top-level container that manages a set of Routes and Configurations which implement a network service. Service exists to provide a singular abstraction which can be access controlled, reasoned about, and which encapsulates software lifecycle decisions such as rollout policy and team resource ownership. Service acts only as an orchestrator of the underlying Routes and Configurations (much as a kubernetes Deployment orchestrates ReplicaSets). The Service's controller will track the statuses of its owned Configuration and Route, reflecting their statuses and conditions as its own.

  ## Attributes

  *   `apiVersion` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The API version for this call such as "serving.knative.dev/v1".
  *   `kind` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The kind of resource, in this case "Service".
  *   `metadata` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Run.V1.Model.ObjectMeta.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Metadata associated with this Service, including name, namespace, labels, and annotations. Cloud Run (fully managed) uses the following annotation keys to configure features on a Service: * `run.googleapis.com/ingress` sets the ingress settings for the Service. See [the ingress settings documentation](/run/docs/securing/ingress) for details on configuring ingress settings. * `run.googleapis.com/ingress-status` is output-only and contains the currently active ingress settings for the Service. `run.googleapis.com/ingress-status` may differ from `run.googleapis.com/ingress` while the system is processing a change to `run.googleapis.com/ingress` or if the system failed to process a change to `run.googleapis.com/ingress`. When the system has processed all changes successfully `run.googleapis.com/ingress-status` and `run.googleapis.com/ingress` are equal.
  *   `spec` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Run.V1.Model.ServiceSpec.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Spec holds the desired state of the Service (from the client).
  *   `status` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Run.V1.Model.ServiceStatus.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Status communicates the observed state of the Service (from the controller).
