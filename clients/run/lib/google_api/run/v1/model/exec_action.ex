defmodule GoogleApi.Run.V1.Model.ExecAction do
  @moduledoc """
  Not supported by Cloud Run. ExecAction describes a "run in container" action.

  ## Attributes

  *   `command` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Command is the command line to execute inside the container, the working directory for the command is root ('/') in the container's filesystem. The command is simply exec'd, it is not run inside a shell, so traditional shell instructions ('|', etc) won't work. To use a shell, you need to explicitly call out to that shell. Exit status of 0 is treated as live/healthy and non-zero is unhealthy.
