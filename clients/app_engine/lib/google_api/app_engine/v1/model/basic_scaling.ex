defmodule GoogleApi.AppEngine.V1.Model.BasicScaling do
  @moduledoc """
  A service with basic scaling will create an instance when the application receives a request. The instance will be turned down when the app becomes idle. Basic scaling is ideal for work that is intermittent or driven by user activity.

  ## Attributes

  - idleTimeout (String.t): Duration of time after the last request that an instance must wait before the instance is shut down. Defaults to `nil`.
  - maxInstances (integer()): Maximum number of instances to create for this version. Defaults to `nil`.
