defmodule GoogleApi.AppEngine.V1.Model.StaticFilesHandler do
  @moduledoc """
  Files served directly to the user for a given URL, such as images, CSS stylesheets, or JavaScript source files. Static file handlers describe which files in the application directory are static files, and which URLs serve them.

  ## Attributes

  - applicationReadable (boolean()): Whether files should also be uploaded as code data. By default, files declared in static file handlers are uploaded as static data and are only served to end users; they cannot be read by the application. If enabled, uploads are charged against both your code and static data storage resource quotas. Defaults to `nil`.
  - expiration (String.t): Time a static file served by this handler should be cached by web proxies and browsers. Defaults to `nil`.
  - httpHeaders (map()): HTTP headers to use for all responses from these URLs. Defaults to `nil`.
  - mimeType (String.t): MIME type used to serve all files served by this handler.Defaults to file-specific MIME types, which are derived from each file's filename extension. Defaults to `nil`.
  - path (String.t): Path to the static files matched by the URL pattern, from the application root directory. The path can refer to text matched in groupings in the URL pattern. Defaults to `nil`.
  - requireMatchingFile (boolean()): Whether this handler should match the request if the file referenced by the handler does not exist. Defaults to `nil`.
  - uploadPathRegex (String.t): Regular expression that matches the file paths for all files that should be referenced by this handler. Defaults to `nil`.
