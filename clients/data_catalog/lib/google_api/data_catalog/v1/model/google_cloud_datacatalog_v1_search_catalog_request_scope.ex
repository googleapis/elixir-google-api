  The criteria that select the subspace used for query matching.

  ## Attributes

  *   `includeGcpPublicDatasets` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - If `true`, include Google Cloud Platform (GCP) public datasets in search results. By default, they are excluded. See [Google Cloud Public Datasets](/public-datasets) for more information.
  *   `includeOrgIds` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The list of organization IDs to search within. To find your organization ID, follow the steps from [Creating and managing organizations] (/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization).
  *   `includeProjectIds` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The list of project IDs to search within. For more information on the distinction between project names, IDs, and numbers, see [Projects](/docs/overview/#projects).
  *   `includePublicTagTemplates` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. If `true`, include public tag templates in the search results. By default, they are included only if you have explicit permissions on them to view them. For example, if you are the owner. Other scope fields, for example, `include_org_ids`, still restrict the returned public tag templates and at least one of them is required.
  *   `restrictedLocations` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. The list of locations to search within. If empty, all locations are searched. Returns an error if any location in the list isn't one of the [Supported regions](https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog/docs/concepts/regions#supported_regions). If a location is unreachable, its name is returned in the `SearchCatalogResponse.unreachable` field. To get additional information on the error, repeat the search request and set the location name as the value of this parameter.
  *   `starredOnly` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. If `true`, search only among starred entries. By default, all results are returned, starred or not.
