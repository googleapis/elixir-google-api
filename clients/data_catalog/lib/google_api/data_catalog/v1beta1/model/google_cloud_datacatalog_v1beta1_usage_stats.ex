defmodule GoogleApi.DataCatalog.V1beta1.Model.GoogleCloudDatacatalogV1beta1UsageStats do
  @moduledoc """
  Detailed counts on the entry's usage. Caveats: - Only BigQuery tables have usage stats - The usage stats only inlude BigQuery query jobs - The usage stats might be underestimated, e.g. wildcard table references are not yet counted in usage computation https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying-wildcard-tables

  ## Attributes

  *   `totalCancellations` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - The number of times that the underlying entry was attempted to be used but was cancelled by the user.
  *   `totalCompletions` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - The number of times that the underlying entry was successfully used.
  *   `totalExecutionTimeForCompletionsMillis` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - Total time spent (in milliseconds) during uses the resulted in completions.
  *   `totalFailures` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - The number of times that the underlying entry was attempted to be used but failed.
