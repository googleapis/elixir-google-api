defmodule GoogleApi.VectorTile.V1.Model.Line do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents a 2D polyline. Used to represent segments such as roads, train tracks, etc.

  ## Attributes

  *   `vertexOffsets` (*type:* `GoogleApi.VectorTile.V1.Model.Vertex2DList.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The vertices present in the polyline.
  *   `zOrder` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - The z-order of the line. Lines with a lower z-order should be rendered beneath lines with a higher z-order. This z-ordering does not imply anything about the altitude of the area relative to the ground, but it can be used to prevent z-fighting during rendering on the client. In general, larger and more important road features will have a higher z-order line associated with them. This z-ordering can only be used to compare lines, and cannot be compared with the z_order field in the Area message. The z-order may be negative or zero.
