  ## Attributes

  - backgroundImageFile (TeamDriveBackgroundImageFile):  Defaults to: `null`.

  - capabilities (TeamDriveCapabilities):  Defaults to: `null`.
  - colorRgb (String.t): The color of this Team Drive as an RGB hex string. It can only be set on a drive.teamdrives.update request that does not set themeId. Defaults to: `null`.
  - createdTime (DateTime.t): The time at which the Team Drive was created (RFC 3339 date-time). Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String.t): The ID of this Team Drive which is also the ID of the top level folder for this Team Drive. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String.t): Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string \&quot;drive#teamDrive\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): The name of this Team Drive. Defaults to: `null`.
  - themeId (String.t): The ID of the theme from which the background image and color will be set. The set of possible teamDriveThemes can be retrieved from a drive.about.get response. When not specified on a drive.teamdrives.create request, a random theme is chosen from which the background image and color are set. This is a write-only field; it can only be set on requests that don&#39;t set colorRgb or backgroundImageFile. Defaults to: `null`.
