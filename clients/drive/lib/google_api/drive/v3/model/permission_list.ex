defmodule GoogleApi.Drive.V3.Model.PermissionList do
  @moduledoc """
  A list of permissions for a file.

  ## Attributes

  - kind (String.t): Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string \&quot;drive#permissionList\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - nextPageToken (String.t): The page token for the next page of permissions. This field will be absent if the end of the permissions list has been reached. If the token is rejected for any reason, it should be discarded, and pagination should be restarted from the first page of results. Defaults to: `null`.
  - permissions ([Permission]): The list of permissions. If nextPageToken is populated, then this list may be incomplete and an additional page of results should be fetched. Defaults to: `null`.
