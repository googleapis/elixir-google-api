defmodule GoogleApi.CloudErrorReporting.V1beta1.Model.ErrorContext do
  @moduledoc """
  A description of the context in which an error occurred.
  This data should be provided by the application when reporting an error,
  unless the
  error report has been generated automatically from Google App Engine logs.

  ## Attributes

  - httpRequest (GoogleApi.CloudErrorReporting.V1beta1.Model.HttpRequestContext.t): The HTTP request which was processed when the error was
  triggered. Defaults to `nil`.
  - reportLocation (GoogleApi.CloudErrorReporting.V1beta1.Model.SourceLocation.t): The location in the source code where the decision was made to
  report the error, usually the place where it was logged.
  For a logged exception this would be the source line where the
  exception is logged, usually close to the place where it was
  caught. Defaults to `nil`.
  - sourceReferences (list(GoogleApi.CloudErrorReporting.V1beta1.Model.SourceReference.t)): Source code that was used to build the executable which has
  caused the given error message. Defaults to `nil`.
  - user (String.t): The user who caused or was affected by the crash.
  This can be a user ID, an email address, or an arbitrary token that
  uniquely identifies the user.
  When sending an error report, leave this field empty if the user was not
  logged in. In this case the
  Error Reporting system will use other data, such as remote IP address, to
  distinguish affected users. See `affected_users_count` in
  `ErrorGroupStats`. Defaults to `nil`.
