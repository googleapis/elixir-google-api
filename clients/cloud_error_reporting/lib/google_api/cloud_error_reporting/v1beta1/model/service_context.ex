defmodule GoogleApi.CloudErrorReporting.V1beta1.Model.ServiceContext do
  @moduledoc """
  Describes a running service that sends errors.
  Its version changes over time and multiple versions can run in parallel.

  ## Attributes

  - resourceType (String.t): Type of the MonitoredResource. List of possible values:
  https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/resources

  Value is set automatically for incoming errors and must not be set when
  reporting errors. Defaults to `nil`.
  - service (String.t): An identifier of the service, such as the name of the
  executable, job, or Google App Engine service name. This field is expected
  to have a low number of values that are relatively stable over time, as
  opposed to `version`, which can be changed whenever new code is deployed.

  Contains the service name for error reports extracted from Google
  App Engine logs or `default` if the App Engine default service is used. Defaults to `nil`.
  - version (String.t): Represents the source code version that the developer provided,
  which could represent a version label or a Git SHA-1 hash, for example.
  For App Engine standard environment, the version is set to the version of
  the app. Defaults to `nil`.
