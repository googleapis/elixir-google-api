defmodule GoogleApi.Firestore.V1beta1.Model.Target do
  @moduledoc """
  A specification of a set of documents to listen to.

  ## Attributes

  - documents (DocumentsTarget): A target specified by a set of document names. Defaults to: `null`.
  - once (boolean()): If the target should be removed once it is current and consistent. Defaults to: `null`.
  - query (QueryTarget): A target specified by a query. Defaults to: `null`.
  - readTime (String.t): Start listening after a specific &#x60;read_time&#x60;.  The client must know the state of matching documents at this time. Defaults to: `null`.
  - resumeToken (binary()): A resume token from a prior TargetChange for an identical target.  Using a resume token with a different target is unsupported and may fail. Defaults to: `null`.
  - targetId (integer()): A client provided target ID.  If not set, the server will assign an ID for the target.  Used for resuming a target without changing IDs. The IDs can either be client-assigned or be server-assigned in a previous stream. All targets with client provided IDs must be added before adding a target that needs a server-assigned id. Defaults to: `null`.
