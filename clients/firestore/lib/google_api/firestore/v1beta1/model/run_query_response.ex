defmodule GoogleApi.Firestore.V1beta1.Model.RunQueryResponse do
  @moduledoc """
  The response for Firestore.RunQuery.

  ## Attributes

  - document (GoogleApi.Firestore.V1beta1.Model.Document.t): A query result.
  Not set when reporting partial progress. Defaults to `nil`.
  - readTime (DateTime.t): The time at which the document was read. This may be monotonically
  increasing; in this case, the previous documents in the result stream are
  guaranteed not to have changed between their `read_time` and this one.

  If the query returns no results, a response with `read_time` and no
  `document` will be sent, and this represents the time at which the query
  was run. Defaults to `nil`.
  - skippedResults (integer()): The number of results that have been skipped due to an offset between
  the last response and the current response. Defaults to `nil`.
  - transaction (String.t): The transaction that was started as part of this request.
  Can only be set in the first response, and only if
  RunQueryRequest.new_transaction was set in the request.
  If set, no other fields will be set in this response. Defaults to `nil`.
