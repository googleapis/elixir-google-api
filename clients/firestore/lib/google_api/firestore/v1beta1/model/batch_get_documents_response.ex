defmodule GoogleApi.Firestore.V1beta1.Model.BatchGetDocumentsResponse do
  @moduledoc """
  The streamed response for Firestore.BatchGetDocuments.

  ## Attributes

  - found (GoogleApi.Firestore.V1beta1.Model.Document.t): A document that was requested. Defaults to `nil`.
  - missing (String.t): A document name that was requested but does not exist. In the format:
  `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/documents/{document_path}`. Defaults to `nil`.
  - readTime (DateTime.t): The time at which the document was read.
  This may be monotically increasing, in this case the previous documents in
  the result stream are guaranteed not to have changed between their
  read_time and this one. Defaults to `nil`.
  - transaction (String.t): The transaction that was started as part of this request.
  Will only be set in the first response, and only if
  BatchGetDocumentsRequest.new_transaction was set in the request. Defaults to `nil`.
