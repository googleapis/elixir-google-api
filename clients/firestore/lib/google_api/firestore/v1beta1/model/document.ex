defmodule GoogleApi.Firestore.V1beta1.Model.Document do
  @moduledoc """
  A Firestore document.

  Must not exceed 1 MiB - 4 bytes.

  ## Attributes

  - createTime (DateTime.t): Output only. The time at which the document was created.

  This value increases monotonically when a document is deleted then
  recreated. It can also be compared to values from other documents and
  the `read_time` of a query. Defaults to `nil`.
  - fields (%{optional(String.t) => GoogleApi.Firestore.V1beta1.Model.Value.t}): The document's fields.

  The map keys represent field names.

  A simple field name contains only characters `a` to `z`, `A` to `Z`,
  `0` to `9`, or `_`, and must not start with `0` to `9`. For example,
  `foo_bar_17`.

  Field names matching the regular expression `__.*__` are reserved. Reserved
  field names are forbidden except in certain documented contexts. The map
  keys, represented as UTF-8, must not exceed 1,500 bytes and cannot be
  empty.

  Field paths may be used in other contexts to refer to structured fields
  defined here. For `map_value`, the field path is represented by the simple
  or quoted field names of the containing fields, delimited by `.`. For
  example, the structured field
  `"foo" : { map_value: { "x&y" : { string_value: "hello" }}}` would be
  represented by the field path `foo.x&y`.

  Within a field path, a quoted field name starts and ends with `` ` `` and
  may contain any character. Some characters, including `` ` ``, must be
  escaped using a `\`. For example, `` `x&y` `` represents `x&y` and
  `` `bak\`tik` `` represents `` bak`tik ``. Defaults to `nil`.
  - name (String.t): The resource name of the document, for example
  `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/documents/{document_path}`. Defaults to `nil`.
  - updateTime (DateTime.t): Output only. The time at which the document was last changed.

  This value is initially set to the `create_time` then increases
  monotonically with each change to the document. It can also be
  compared to values from other documents and the `read_time` of a query. Defaults to `nil`.
