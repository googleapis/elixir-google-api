defmodule GoogleApi.Firestore.V1beta1.Model.DocumentRemove do
  @moduledoc """
  A Document has been removed from the view of the targets.

  Sent if the document is no longer relevant to a target and is out of view.
  Can be sent instead of a DocumentDelete or a DocumentChange if the server
  can not send the new value of the document.

  Multiple DocumentRemove messages may be returned for the same logical
  write or delete, if multiple targets are affected.

  ## Attributes

  - document (String.t): The resource name of the Document that has gone out of view. Defaults to `nil`.
  - readTime (DateTime.t): The read timestamp at which the remove was observed.

  Greater or equal to the `commit_time` of the change/delete/remove. Defaults to `nil`.
  - removedTargetIds (list(integer())): A set of target IDs for targets that previously matched this document. Defaults to `nil`.
