defmodule GoogleApi.Firestore.V1.Model.Document do
  @moduledoc """
  A Firestore document. Must not exceed 1 MiB - 4 bytes.

  ## Attributes

  *   `createTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The time at which the document was created. This value increases monotonically when a document is deleted then recreated. It can also be compared to values from other documents and the `read_time` of a query.
  *   `fields` (*type:* `%{optional(String.t) => GoogleApi.Firestore.V1.Model.Value.t}`, *default:* `nil`) - The document's fields. The map keys represent field names. Field names matching the regular expression `__.*__` are reserved. Reserved field names are forbidden except in certain documented contexts. The field names, represented as UTF-8, must not exceed 1,500 bytes and cannot be empty. Field paths may be used in other contexts to refer to structured fields defined here. For `map_value`, the field path is represented by a dot-delimited (`.`) string of segments. Each segment is either a simple field name (defined below) or a quoted field name. For example, the structured field `"foo" : { map_value: { "x&y" : { string_value: "hello" }}}` would be represented by the field path `` foo.`x&y` ``. A simple field name contains only characters `a` to `z`, `A` to `Z`, `0` to `9`, or `_`, and must not start with `0` to `9`. For example, `foo_bar_17`. A quoted field name starts and ends with `` ` `` and may contain any character. Some characters, including `` ` ``, must be escaped using a `\\`. For example, `` `x&y` `` represents `x&y` and `` `bak\\`tik` `` represents `` bak`tik ``.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The resource name of the document, for example `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/documents/{document_path}`.
  *   `updateTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The time at which the document was last changed. This value is initially set to the `create_time` then increases monotonically with each change to the document. It can also be compared to values from other documents and the `read_time` of a query.
