defmodule GoogleApi.Firestore.V1.Model.RunQueryResponse do
  @moduledoc """
  The response for Firestore.RunQuery.

  ## Attributes

  *   `document` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Firestore.V1.Model.Document.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A query result, not set when reporting partial progress.
  *   `done` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - If present, Firestore has completely finished the request and no more documents will be returned.
  *   `explainMetrics` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Firestore.V1.Model.ExplainMetrics.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Query explain metrics. This is only present when the RunQueryRequest.explain_options is provided, and it is sent only once with the last response in the stream.
  *   `readTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The time at which the document was read. This may be monotonically increasing; in this case, the previous documents in the result stream are guaranteed not to have changed between their `read_time` and this one. If the query returns no results, a response with `read_time` and no `document` will be sent, and this represents the time at which the query was run.
  *   `skippedResults` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - The number of results that have been skipped due to an offset between the last response and the current response.
  *   `transaction` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The transaction that was started as part of this request. Can only be set in the first response, and only if RunQueryRequest.new_transaction was set in the request. If set, no other fields will be set in this response.
