defmodule GoogleApi.Vision.V1.Model.GoogleCloudVisionV1p5beta1GcsDestination do
  @moduledoc """
  The Google Cloud Storage location where the output will be written to.

  ## Attributes

  *   `uri` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Google Cloud Storage URI prefix where the results will be stored. Results
      will be in JSON format and preceded by its corresponding input URI prefix.
      This field can either represent a gcs file prefix or gcs directory. In
      either case, the uri should be unique because in order to get all of the
      output files, you will need to do a wildcard gcs search on the uri prefix
      you provide.

      Examples:

      *    File Prefix: gs://bucket-name/here/filenameprefix   The output files
      will be created in gs://bucket-name/here/ and the names of the
      output files will begin with "filenameprefix".

      *    Directory Prefix: gs://bucket-name/some/location/   The output files
      will be created in gs://bucket-name/some/location/ and the names of the
      output files could be anything because there was no filename prefix
      specified.

      If multiple outputs, each response is still AnnotateFileResponse, each of
      which contains some subset of the full list of AnnotateImageResponse.
      Multiple outputs can happen if, for example, the output JSON is too large
      and overflows into multiple sharded files.
