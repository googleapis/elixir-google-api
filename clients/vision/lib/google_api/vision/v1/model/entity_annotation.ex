defmodule GoogleApi.Vision.V1.Model.EntityAnnotation do
  @moduledoc """
  Set of detected entity features.

  ## Attributes

  - boundingPoly (GoogleApi.Vision.V1.Model.BoundingPoly.t): Image region to which this entity belongs. Not produced
  for `LABEL_DETECTION` features. Defaults to `nil`.
  - confidence (number()): **Deprecated. Use `score` instead.**
  The accuracy of the entity detection in an image.
  For example, for an image in which the "Eiffel Tower" entity is detected,
  this field represents the confidence that there is a tower in the query
  image. Range [0, 1]. Defaults to `nil`.
  - description (String.t): Entity textual description, expressed in its `locale` language. Defaults to `nil`.
  - locale (String.t): The language code for the locale in which the entity textual
  `description` is expressed. Defaults to `nil`.
  - locations (list(GoogleApi.Vision.V1.Model.LocationInfo.t)): The location information for the detected entity. Multiple
  `LocationInfo` elements can be present because one location may
  indicate the location of the scene in the image, and another location
  may indicate the location of the place where the image was taken.
  Location information is usually present for landmarks. Defaults to `nil`.
  - mid (String.t): Opaque entity ID. Some IDs may be available in
  [Google Knowledge Graph Search
  API](https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph/). Defaults to `nil`.
  - properties (list(GoogleApi.Vision.V1.Model.Property.t)): Some entities may have optional user-supplied `Property` (name/value)
  fields, such a score or string that qualifies the entity. Defaults to `nil`.
  - score (number()): Overall score of the result. Range [0, 1]. Defaults to `nil`.
  - topicality (number()): The relevancy of the ICA (Image Content Annotation) label to the
  image. For example, the relevancy of "tower" is likely higher to an image
  containing the detected "Eiffel Tower" than to an image containing a
  detected distant towering building, even though the confidence that
  there is a tower in each image may be the same. Range [0, 1]. Defaults to `nil`.
