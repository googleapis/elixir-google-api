defmodule GoogleApi.Vision.V1.Model.FaceAnnotation do
  @moduledoc """
  A face annotation object contains the results of face detection.

  ## Attributes

  - angerLikelihood (String.t): Anger likelihood. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [UNKNOWN, VERY_UNLIKELY, UNLIKELY, POSSIBLE, LIKELY, VERY_LIKELY]
  - blurredLikelihood (String.t): Blurred likelihood. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [UNKNOWN, VERY_UNLIKELY, UNLIKELY, POSSIBLE, LIKELY, VERY_LIKELY]
  - boundingPoly (BoundingPoly): The bounding polygon around the face. The coordinates of the bounding box are in the original image&#39;s scale. The bounding box is computed to \&quot;frame\&quot; the face in accordance with human expectations. It is based on the landmarker results. Note that one or more x and/or y coordinates may not be generated in the &#x60;BoundingPoly&#x60; (the polygon will be unbounded) if only a partial face appears in the image to be annotated. Defaults to: `null`.
  - detectionConfidence (float()): Detection confidence. Range [0, 1]. Defaults to: `null`.
  - fdBoundingPoly (BoundingPoly): The &#x60;fd_bounding_poly&#x60; bounding polygon is tighter than the &#x60;boundingPoly&#x60;, and encloses only the skin part of the face. Typically, it is used to eliminate the face from any image analysis that detects the \&quot;amount of skin\&quot; visible in an image. It is not based on the landmarker results, only on the initial face detection, hence the &lt;code&gt;fd&lt;/code&gt; (face detection) prefix. Defaults to: `null`.
  - headwearLikelihood (String.t): Headwear likelihood. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [UNKNOWN, VERY_UNLIKELY, UNLIKELY, POSSIBLE, LIKELY, VERY_LIKELY]
  - joyLikelihood (String.t): Joy likelihood. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [UNKNOWN, VERY_UNLIKELY, UNLIKELY, POSSIBLE, LIKELY, VERY_LIKELY]
  - landmarkingConfidence (float()): Face landmarking confidence. Range [0, 1]. Defaults to: `null`.
  - landmarks ([Landmark]): Detected face landmarks. Defaults to: `null`.
  - panAngle (float()): Yaw angle, which indicates the leftward/rightward angle that the face is pointing relative to the vertical plane perpendicular to the image. Range [-180,180]. Defaults to: `null`.
  - rollAngle (float()): Roll angle, which indicates the amount of clockwise/anti-clockwise rotation of the face relative to the image vertical about the axis perpendicular to the face. Range [-180,180]. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sorrowLikelihood (String.t): Sorrow likelihood. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [UNKNOWN, VERY_UNLIKELY, UNLIKELY, POSSIBLE, LIKELY, VERY_LIKELY]
  - surpriseLikelihood (String.t): Surprise likelihood. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [UNKNOWN, VERY_UNLIKELY, UNLIKELY, POSSIBLE, LIKELY, VERY_LIKELY]
  - tiltAngle (float()): Pitch angle, which indicates the upwards/downwards angle that the face is pointing relative to the image&#39;s horizontal plane. Range [-180,180]. Defaults to: `null`.
  - underExposedLikelihood (String.t): Under-exposed likelihood. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [UNKNOWN, VERY_UNLIKELY, UNLIKELY, POSSIBLE, LIKELY, VERY_LIKELY]
