  @moduledoc """
  Set of features pertaining to the image, computed by computer vision methods over safe-search verticals (for example, adult, spoof, medical, violence).

  ## Attributes

  *   `adult` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Represents the adult content likelihood for the image. Adult content may contain elements such as nudity, pornographic images or cartoons, or sexual activities.
  *   `medical` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Likelihood that this is a medical image.

  *   `spoof` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Spoof likelihood. The likelihood that an modification was made to the image's canonical version to make it appear funny or offensive.
  *   `violence` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Likelihood that this image contains violent content. Violent content may include death, serious harm, or injury to individuals or groups of individuals.
