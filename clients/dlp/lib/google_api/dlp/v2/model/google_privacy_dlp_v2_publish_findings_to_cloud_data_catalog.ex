defmodule GoogleApi.DLP.V2.Model.GooglePrivacyDlpV2PublishFindingsToCloudDataCatalog do
  @moduledoc """
  Publish findings of a DlpJob to Cloud Data Catalog. Labels summarizing the
  results of the DlpJob will be applied to the entry for the resource scanned
  in Cloud Data Catalog. Any labels previously written by another DlpJob will
  be deleted. InfoType naming patterns are strictly enforced when using this
  feature. Note that the findings will be persisted in Cloud Data Catalog
  storage and are governed by Data Catalog service-specific policy, see
  https://cloud.google.com/terms/service-terms
  Only a single instance of this action can be specified and only allowed if
  all resources being scanned are BigQuery tables.
