defmodule GoogleApi.DLP.V2.Model.GooglePrivacyDlpV2HybridOptions do
  @moduledoc """
  Configuration to control jobs where the content being inspected is outside
  of Google Cloud Platform.

  ## Attributes

  *   `description` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A short description of where the data is coming from. Will be stored once
      in the job. 256 max length.
  *   `labels` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - To organize findings, these labels will be added to each finding.

      Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform
      to the following regular expression: \\[a-z\\](\\[-a-z0-9\\]*\\[a-z0-9\\])?.

      Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform
      to the regular expression (\\[a-z\\](\\[-a-z0-9\\]*\\[a-z0-9\\])?)?.

      No more than 10 labels can be associated with a given finding.

      Example: <code>"environment" : "production"</code>
      Example: <code>"pipeline" : "etl"</code>
  *   `requiredFindingLabelKeys` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - These are labels that each inspection request must include within their
      'finding_labels' map. Request may contain others, but any missing one of
      these will be rejected.

      Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform
      to the following regular expression: \\[a-z\\](\\[-a-z0-9\\]*\\[a-z0-9\\])?.

      No more than 10 keys can be required.
  *   `tableOptions` (*type:* `GoogleApi.DLP.V2.Model.GooglePrivacyDlpV2TableOptions.t`, *default:* `nil`) - If the container is a table, additional information to make findings
      meaningful such as the columns that are primary keys.
