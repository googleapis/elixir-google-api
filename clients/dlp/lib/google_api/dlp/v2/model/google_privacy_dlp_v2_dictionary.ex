defmodule GoogleApi.DLP.V2.Model.GooglePrivacyDlpV2Dictionary do
  @moduledoc """
  Custom information type based on a dictionary of words or phrases. This can be used to match sensitive information specific to the data, such as a list of employee IDs or job titles.  Dictionary words are case-insensitive and all characters other than letters and digits in the unicode [Basic Multilingual Plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_%28Unicode%29#Basic_Multilingual_Plane) will be replaced with whitespace when scanning for matches, so the dictionary phrase \&quot;Sam Johnson\&quot; will match all three phrases \&quot;sam johnson\&quot;, \&quot;Sam, Johnson\&quot;, and \&quot;Sam (Johnson)\&quot;. Additionally, the characters surrounding any match must be of a different type than the adjacent characters within the word, so letters must be next to non-letters and digits next to non-digits. For example, the dictionary word \&quot;jen\&quot; will match the first three letters of the text \&quot;jen123\&quot; but will return no matches for \&quot;jennifer\&quot;.  Dictionary words containing a large number of characters that are not letters or digits may result in unexpected findings because such characters are treated as whitespace.
