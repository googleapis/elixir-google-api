defmodule GoogleApi.DLP.V2.Model.GooglePrivacyDlpV2HybridFindingDetails do
  @moduledoc """
  Populate to associate additional data with each finding.
  Early access feature is in a pre-release state and might change or have
  limited support. For more information, see
  https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages.

  ## Attributes

  *   `containerDetails` (*type:* `GoogleApi.DLP.V2.Model.GooglePrivacyDlpV2Container.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Details about the container where the content being inspected is from.
  *   `fileOffset` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Offset in bytes of the line, from the beginning of the file, where the
      finding  is located. Populate if the item being scanned is only part of a
      bigger item, such as a shard of a file and you want to track the absolute
      position of the finding.
  *   `labels` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - Labels to represent user provided metadata about the data being inspected.
      If configured by the job, some key values may be required.
      The labels associated with `Finding`'s produced by hybrid
      inspection.

      Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform
      to the following regular expression: \\[a-z\\](\\[-a-z0-9\\]*\\[a-z0-9\\])?.

      Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform
      to the regular expression (\\[a-z\\](\\[-a-z0-9\\]*\\[a-z0-9\\])?)?.

      No more than 10 labels can be associated with a given finding.

      Example: <code>"environment" : "production"</code>
      Example: <code>"pipeline" : "etl"</code>
  *   `rowOffset` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Offset of the row for tables. Populate if the row(s) being scanned are
      part of a bigger dataset and you want to keep track of their absolute
      position.
  *   `tableOptions` (*type:* `GoogleApi.DLP.V2.Model.GooglePrivacyDlpV2TableOptions.t`, *default:* `nil`) - If the container is a table, additional information to make findings
      meaningful such as the columns that are primary keys. If not known ahead
      of time, can also be set within each inspect hybrid call and the two
      will be merged. Note that identifying_fields will only be stored to
      BigQuery, and only if the BigQuery action has been included.
