defmodule GoogleApi.DLP.V2.Model.GooglePrivacyDlpV2KAnonymityConfig do
  @moduledoc """
  k-anonymity metric, used for analysis of reidentification risk.

  ## Attributes

  - entityId (GooglePrivacyDlpV2EntityId): Optional message indicating that multiple rows might be associated to a single individual. If the same entity_id is associated to multiple quasi-identifier tuples over distict rows, we consider the entire collection of tuples as the composite quasi-identifier. This collection is a multiset: the order in which the different tuples appear in the dataset is ignored, but their frequency is taken into account.  Important note: a maximum of 1000 rows can be associated to a single entity ID. If more rows are associated with the same entity ID, some might be ignored. Defaults to: `null`.
  - quasiIds ([GooglePrivacyDlpV2FieldId]): Set of fields to compute k-anonymity over. When multiple fields are specified, they are considered a single composite key. Structs and repeated data types are not supported; however, nested fields are supported so long as they are not structs themselves or nested within a repeated field. Defaults to: `null`.
