defmodule GoogleApi.DLP.V2.Model.GooglePrivacyDlpV2LikelihoodAdjustment do
  @moduledoc """
  Message for specifying an adjustment to the likelihood of a finding as
  part of a detection rule.

  ## Attributes

  *   `fixedLikelihood` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Set the likelihood of a finding to a fixed value.
  *   `relativeLikelihood` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Increase or decrease the likelihood by the specified number of
      levels. For example, if a finding would be `POSSIBLE` without the
      detection rule and `relative_likelihood` is 1, then it is upgraded to
      `LIKELY`, while a value of -1 would downgrade it to `UNLIKELY`.
      Likelihood may never drop below `VERY_UNLIKELY` or exceed
      `VERY_LIKELY`, so applying an adjustment of 1 followed by an
      adjustment of -1 when base likelihood is `VERY_LIKELY` will result in
      a final likelihood of `LIKELY`.
