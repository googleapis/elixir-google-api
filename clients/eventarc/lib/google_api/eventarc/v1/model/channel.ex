defmodule GoogleApi.Eventarc.V1.Model.Channel do
  @moduledoc """
  A representation of the Channel resource. A Channel is a resource on which event providers publish their events. The published events are delivered through the transport associated with the channel. Note that a channel is associated with exactly one event provider.

  ## Attributes

  *   `activationToken` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The activation token for the channel. The token must be used by the provider to register the channel for publishing.
  *   `createTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The creation time.
  *   `cryptoKeyName` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Resource name of a KMS crypto key (managed by the user) used to encrypt/decrypt their event data. It must match the pattern `projects/*/locations/*/keyRings/*/cryptoKeys/*`.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The resource name of the channel. Must be unique within the location on the project and must be in `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/channels/{channel_id}` format.
  *   `provider` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The name of the event provider (e.g. Eventarc SaaS partner) associated with the channel. This provider will be granted permissions to publish events to the channel. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/providers/{provider_id}`.
  *   `pubsubTopic` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The name of the Pub/Sub topic created and managed by Eventarc system as a transport for the event delivery. Format: `projects/{project}/topics/{topic_id}`.
  *   `state` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The state of a Channel.
  *   `uid` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. Server assigned unique identifier for the channel. The value is a UUID4 string and guaranteed to remain unchanged until the resource is deleted.
  *   `updateTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The last-modified time.
