  ## Attributes

  *   `binaryVersion` (*type:* `GoogleApi.OnDemandScanning.V1.Model.PackageVersion.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The binary package. This is significant when the source is different than the binary itself. Historically if they've differed, we've stored the name of the source and its version in the package/version fields, but we should also store the binary package info, as that's what's actually installed. See b/175908657#comment15.
  *   `sourceVersion` (*type:* `GoogleApi.OnDemandScanning.V1.Model.PackageVersion.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The source package. Similar to the above, this is significant when the source is different than the binary itself. Since the top-level package/version fields are based on an if/else, we need a separate field for both binary and source if we want to know definitively where the data is coming from.
