defmodule GoogleApi.OnDemandScanning.V1.Model.Signature do
  @moduledoc """
  Verifiers (e.g. Kritis implementations) MUST verify signatures with respect to the trust anchors defined in policy (e.g. a Kritis policy). Typically this means that the verifier has been configured with a map from `public_key_id` to public key material (and any required parameters, e.g. signing algorithm). In particular, verification implementations MUST NOT treat the signature `public_key_id` as anything more than a key lookup hint. The `public_key_id` DOES NOT validate or authenticate a public key; it only provides a mechanism for quickly selecting a public key ALREADY CONFIGURED on the verifier through a trusted channel. Verification implementations MUST reject signatures in any of the following circumstances: * The `public_key_id` is not recognized by the verifier. * The public key that `public_key_id` refers to does not verify the signature with respect to the payload. The `signature` contents SHOULD NOT be "attached" (where the payload is included with the serialized `signature` bytes). Verifiers MUST ignore any "attached" payload and only verify signatures with respect to explicitly provided payload (e.g. a `payload` field on the proto message that holds this Signature, or the canonical serialization of the proto message that holds this signature).

  ## Attributes

  *   `publicKeyId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The identifier for the public key that verifies this signature. * The `public_key_id` is required. * The `public_key_id` SHOULD be an RFC3986 conformant URI. * When possible, the `public_key_id` SHOULD be an immutable reference, such as a cryptographic digest. Examples of valid `public_key_id`s: OpenPGP V4 public key fingerprint: * "openpgp4fpr:74FAF3B861BDA0870C7B6DEF607E48D2A663AEEA" See https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/openpgp4fpr for more details on this scheme. RFC6920 digest-named SubjectPublicKeyInfo (digest of the DER serialization): * "ni:///sha-256;cD9o9Cq6LG3jD0iKXqEi_vdjJGecm_iXkbqVoScViaU" * "nih:///sha-256;703f68f42aba2c6de30f488a5ea122fef76324679c9bf89791ba95a1271589a5"
  *   `signature` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The content of the signature, an opaque bytestring. The payload that this signature verifies MUST be unambiguously provided with the Signature during verification. A wrapper message might provide the payload explicitly. Alternatively, a message might have a canonical serialization that can always be unambiguously computed to derive the payload.
