defmodule GoogleApi.Fitness.V1.Model.DataPoint do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents a single data point, generated by a particular data source. A data point holds a value for each field, an end timestamp and an optional start time. The exact semantics of each of these attributes are specified in the documentation for the particular data type.  A data point can represent an instantaneous measurement, reading or input observation, as well as averages or aggregates over a time interval. Check the data type documentation to determine which is the case for a particular data type.  Data points always contain one value for each field of the data type.
