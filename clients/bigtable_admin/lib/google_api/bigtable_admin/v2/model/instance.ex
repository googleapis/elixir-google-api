defmodule GoogleApi.BigtableAdmin.V2.Model.Instance do
  @moduledoc """
  A collection of Bigtable Tables and the resources that serve them. All tables in an instance are served from all Clusters in the instance.

  ## Attributes

  *   `createTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. A server-assigned timestamp representing when this Instance was created. For instances created before this field was added (August 2021), this value is `seconds: 0, nanos: 1`.
  *   `displayName` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The descriptive name for this instance as it appears in UIs. Can be changed at any time, but should be kept globally unique to avoid confusion.
  *   `labels` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. Labels are a flexible and lightweight mechanism for organizing cloud resources into groups that reflect a customer's organizational needs and deployment strategies. They can be used to filter resources and aggregate metrics. * Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to the regular expression: `\\p{Ll}\\p{Lo}{0,62}`. * Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform to the regular expression: `[\\p{Ll}\\p{Lo}\\p{N}_-]{0,63}`. * No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given resource. * Keys and values must both be under 128 bytes.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The unique name of the instance. Values are of the form `projects/{project}/instances/a-z+[a-z0-9]`.
  *   `state` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The current state of the instance.
  *   `type` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The type of the instance. Defaults to `PRODUCTION`.
