defmodule GoogleApi.BigtableAdmin.V2.Model.SingleClusterRouting do

  Unconditionally routes all read/write requests to a specific cluster. This option preserves read-your-writes consistency but does not improve availability.

  ## Attributes

  *   `allowTransactionalWrites` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Whether or not `CheckAndMutateRow` and `ReadModifyWriteRow` requests are allowed by this app profile. It is unsafe to send these requests to the same table/row/column in multiple clusters.
  *   `clusterId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The cluster to which read/write requests should be routed.
