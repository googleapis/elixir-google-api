  If enabled, the AFE will route the request based on the row key of the request, rather than randomly. Instead, each row key will be assigned to a cluster, and will stick to that cluster. If clusters are added or removed, then this may affect which row keys stick to which clusters. To avoid this, users can specify a group cluster.
