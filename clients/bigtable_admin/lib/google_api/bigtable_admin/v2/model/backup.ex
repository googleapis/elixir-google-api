defmodule GoogleApi.BigtableAdmin.V2.Model.Backup do
  @moduledoc """
  A backup of a Cloud Bigtable table.

  ## Attributes

  *   `encryptionInfo` (*type:* `GoogleApi.BigtableAdmin.V2.Model.EncryptionInfo.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The encryption information for the backup.
  *   `endTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. `end_time` is the time that the backup was finished. The row data in the backup will be no newer than this timestamp.
  *   `expireTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The expiration time of the backup, with microseconds granularity that must be at least 6 hours and at most 30 days from the time the request is received. Once the `expire_time` has passed, Cloud Bigtable will delete the backup and free the resources used by the backup.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A globally unique identifier for the backup which cannot be changed. Values are of the form `projects/{project}/instances/{instance}/clusters/{cluster}/ backups/_a-zA-Z0-9*` The final segment of the name must be between 1 and 50 characters in length. The backup is stored in the cluster identified by the prefix of the backup name of the form `projects/{project}/instances/{instance}/clusters/{cluster}`.
  *   `sizeBytes` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. Size of the backup in bytes.
  *   `sourceBackup` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. Name of the backup from which this backup was copied. If a backup is not created by copying a backup, this field will be empty. Values are of the form: projects//instances//backups/.
  *   `sourceTable` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. Immutable. Name of the table from which this backup was created. This needs to be in the same instance as the backup. Values are of the form `projects/{project}/instances/{instance}/tables/{source_table}`.
  *   `startTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. `start_time` is the time that the backup was started (i.e. approximately the time the CreateBackup request is received). The row data in this backup will be no older than this timestamp.
  *   `state` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The current state of the backup.
