defmodule GoogleApi.OSConfig.V1.Model.WeekDayOfMonth do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents one week day in a month. An example is "the 4th Sunday".

  ## Attributes

  *   `dayOfWeek` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. A day of the week.
  *   `dayOffset` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. Represents the number of days before or after the given week day of month that the patch deployment is scheduled for. For example if `week_ordinal` and `day_of_week` values point to the second day of the month and this `day_offset` value is set to `3`, the patch deployment takes place three days after the second Tuesday of the month. If this value is negative, for example -5, the patches are deployed five days before before the second Tuesday of the month. Allowed values are in range [-30, 30].
  *   `weekOrdinal` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. Week number in a month. 1-4 indicates the 1st to 4th week of the month. -1 indicates the last week of the month.
