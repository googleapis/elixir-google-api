defmodule GoogleApi.AppsActivity.V1.Api.Activities do
  @moduledoc """
  API calls for all endpoints tagged `Activities`.
  """

  alias GoogleApi.AppsActivity.V1.Connection
  alias GoogleApi.Gax.{Request, Response}

  @doc """
  Returns a list of activities visible to the current logged in user. Visible activities are determined by the visibility settings of the object that was acted on, e.g. Drive files a user can see. An activity is a record of past events. Multiple events may be merged if they are similar. A request is scoped to activities from a given Google service using the source parameter.

  ## Parameters

  - connection (GoogleApi.AppsActivity.V1.Connection): Connection to server
  - optional_params (keyword()): [optional] Optional parameters
    - :alt (String.t): Data format for the response.
    - :fields (String.t): Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
    - :key (String.t): API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
    - :oauth_token (String.t): OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
    - :prettyPrint (boolean()): Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
    - :quotaUser (String.t): An opaque string that represents a user for quota purposes. Must not exceed 40 characters.
    - :userIp (String.t): Deprecated. Please use quotaUser instead.
    - :drive.ancestorId (String.t): Identifies the Drive folder containing the items for which to return activities.
    - :drive.fileId (String.t): Identifies the Drive item to return activities for.
    - :groupingStrategy (String.t): Indicates the strategy to use when grouping singleEvents items in the associated combinedEvent object.
    - :pageSize (integer()): The maximum number of events to return on a page. The response includes a continuation token if there are more events.
    - :pageToken (String.t): A token to retrieve a specific page of results.
    - :source (String.t): The Google service from which to return activities. Possible values of source are: 
  - drive.google.com
    - :userId (String.t): The ID used for ACL checks (does not filter the resulting event list by the assigned value). Use the special value me to indicate the currently authenticated user.

  ## Returns
