defmodule GoogleApi.FirebaseAppCheck.V1.Model.GoogleFirebaseAppcheckV1ResourcePolicy do
  @moduledoc """
  App Check enforcement policy for a specific resource of a Firebase service supported by App Check. Note that this policy will override the service-level configuration.

  ## Attributes

  *   `enforcementMode` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The App Check enforcement mode for this resource. This will override the EnforcementMode setting on the service.
  *   `etag` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other fields, and may be sent on update and delete requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding. This etag is strongly validated as defined by RFC 7232.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. Identifier. The relative name of the resource policy object, in the format: ``` projects/{project_number}/services/{service_id}/resourcePolicies/{resource_policy_id} ``` Note that the `service_id` element must be a supported service ID. Currently, the following service IDs are supported: * `oauth2.googleapis.com` (Google Identity for iOS) `resource_policy_id` is a system-generated UID.
  *   `targetResource` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. Service specific name of the resource object to which this policy applies, in the format: * `//oauth2.googleapis.com/projects/{project_number}/oauthClients/{oauth_client_id}` (Google Identity for iOS) Note that the resource must belong to the service specified in the `name` and be from the same project as this policy, but the resource is allowed to be missing at the time of creation of this policy; in that case, we make a best-effort attempt at respecting this policy, but it may not have any effect until the resource is fully created.
  *   `updateTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. Timestamp when this resource policy configuration object was most recently updated.
