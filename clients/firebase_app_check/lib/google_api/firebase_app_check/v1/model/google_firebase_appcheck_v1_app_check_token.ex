defmodule GoogleApi.FirebaseAppCheck.V1.Model.GoogleFirebaseAppcheckV1AppCheckToken do
  @moduledoc """
  Encapsulates an *App Check token*, which are used to access backend services protected by App Check.

  ## Attributes

  *   `token` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The App Check token. App Check tokens are signed [JWTs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) containing claims that identify the attested app and GCP project. This token is used to access Google services protected by App Check. These tokens can also be [verified by your own custom backends](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check/custom-resource-backend) using the Firebase Admin SDK or third-party libraries.
  *   `ttl` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The duration from the time this token is minted until its expiration. This field is intended to ease client-side token management, since the client may have clock skew, but is still able to accurately measure a duration.
