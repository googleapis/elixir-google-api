defmodule GoogleApi.DisplayVideo.V3.Model.PerformanceGoalBidStrategy do
  @moduledoc """
  A strategy that automatically adjusts the bid to meet or beat a specified performance goal.

  ## Attributes

  *   `customBiddingAlgorithmId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The ID of the Custom Bidding Algorithm used by this strategy. Only applicable when performance_goal_type is set to `BIDDING_STRATEGY_PERFORMANCE_GOAL_TYPE_CUSTOM_ALGO`.
  *   `maxAverageCpmBidAmountMicros` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The maximum average CPM that may be bid, in micros of the advertiser's currency. Must be greater than or equal to a billable unit of the given currency. Not applicable when performance_goal_type is set to `BIDDING_STRATEGY_PERFORMANCE_GOAL_TYPE_VIEWABLE_CPM`. For example, 1500000 represents 1.5 standard units of the currency.
  *   `performanceGoalAmountMicros` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The performance goal the bidding strategy will attempt to meet or beat, in micros of the advertiser's currency or in micro of the ROAS (Return On Advertising Spend) value which is also based on advertiser's currency. Must be greater than or equal to a billable unit of the given currency and smaller or equal to upper bounds. Each performance_goal_type has its upper bound: * when performance_goal_type is `BIDDING_STRATEGY_PERFORMANCE_GOAL_TYPE_CPA`, upper bound is 10000.00 USD. * when performance_goal_type is `BIDDING_STRATEGY_PERFORMANCE_GOAL_TYPE_CPC`, upper bound is 1000.00 USD. * when performance_goal_type is `BIDDING_STRATEGY_PERFORMANCE_GOAL_TYPE_VIEWABLE_CPM`, upper bound is 1000.00 USD. * when performance_goal_type is `BIDDING_STRATEGY_PERFORMANCE_GOAL_TYPE_CUSTOM_ALGO`, upper bound is 1000.00 and lower bound is 0.01. Example: If set to `BIDDING_STRATEGY_PERFORMANCE_GOAL_TYPE_VIEWABLE_CPM`, the bid price will be based on the probability that each available impression will be viewable. For example, if viewable CPM target is $2 and an impression is 40% likely to be viewable, the bid price will be $0.80 CPM (40% of $2). For example, 1500000 represents 1.5 standard units of the currency or ROAS value.
  *   `performanceGoalType` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The type of the performance goal that the bidding strategy will try to meet or beat. For line item level usage, the value must be one of: * `BIDDING_STRATEGY_PERFORMANCE_GOAL_TYPE_CPA` * `BIDDING_STRATEGY_PERFORMANCE_GOAL_TYPE_CPC` * `BIDDING_STRATEGY_PERFORMANCE_GOAL_TYPE_VIEWABLE_CPM` * `BIDDING_STRATEGY_PERFORMANCE_GOAL_TYPE_CUSTOM_ALGO`.
