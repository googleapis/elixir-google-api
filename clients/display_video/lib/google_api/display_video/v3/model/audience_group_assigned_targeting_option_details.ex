defmodule GoogleApi.DisplayVideo.V3.Model.AudienceGroupAssignedTargetingOptionDetails do
  @moduledoc """
  Assigned audience group targeting option details. This will be populated in the details field of an AssignedTargetingOption when targeting_type is `TARGETING_TYPE_AUDIENCE_GROUP`. The relation between each group is UNION, except for excluded_first_and_third_party_audience_group and excluded_google_audience_group, of which COMPLEMENT is used as an INTERSECTION with other groups.

  ## Attributes

  *   `excludedFirstAndThirdPartyAudienceGroup` (*type:* `GoogleApi.DisplayVideo.V3.Model.FirstAndThirdPartyAudienceGroup.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The first and third party audience ids and recencies of the excluded first and third party audience group. Used for negative targeting. The COMPLEMENT of the UNION of this group and other excluded audience groups is used as an INTERSECTION to any positive audience targeting. All items are logically ‘OR’ of each other.
  *   `excludedGoogleAudienceGroup` (*type:* `GoogleApi.DisplayVideo.V3.Model.GoogleAudienceGroup.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The Google audience ids of the excluded Google audience group. Used for negative targeting. The COMPLEMENT of the UNION of this group and other excluded audience groups is used as an INTERSECTION to any positive audience targeting. Only contains Affinity, In-market and Installed-apps type Google audiences. All items are logically ‘OR’ of each other.
  *   `includedCombinedAudienceGroup` (*type:* `GoogleApi.DisplayVideo.V3.Model.CombinedAudienceGroup.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The combined audience ids of the included combined audience group. Contains combined audience ids only.
  *   `includedCustomListGroup` (*type:* `GoogleApi.DisplayVideo.V3.Model.CustomListGroup.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The custom list ids of the included custom list group. Contains custom list ids only.
  *   `includedFirstAndThirdPartyAudienceGroups` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.DisplayVideo.V3.Model.FirstAndThirdPartyAudienceGroup.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The first and third party audience ids and recencies of included first and third party audience groups. Each first and third party audience group contains first and third party audience ids only. The relation between each first and third party audience group is INTERSECTION, and the result is UNION'ed with other audience groups. Repeated groups with same settings will be ignored.
