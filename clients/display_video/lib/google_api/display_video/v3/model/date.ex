This can represent one of the following: * A full date, with non-zero year, month, and day values. * A month and day, with a zero year (for example, an anniversary). * A year on its own, with a zero month and a zero day. * A year and month, with a zero day (for example, a credit card expiration date). Related types: * google.type.TimeOfDay * google.type.DateTime * google.protobuf.Timestamp

  ## Attributes

  *   `day` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Day of a month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0 to specify a year by itself or a year and month where the day isn't significant.
  *   `month` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Month of a year. Must be from 1 to 12, or 0 to specify a year without a month and day.
