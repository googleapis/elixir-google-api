  Settings that control the number of times a user may be shown with the same ad during a given time period.

  ## Attributes

  *   `maxImpressions` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - The maximum number of times a user may be shown the same ad during this period. Must be greater than 0. Required when unlimited is `false` and max_views is not set.
  *   `maxViews` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. The maximum number of times a user may click-through or fully view an ad during this period until it is no longer served to them.

  *   `timeUnit` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The time unit in which the frequency cap will be applied. Required when unlimited is `false`. *Warning*: On **February 28, 2025**, frequency cap time periods greater than 30 days will no longer be accepted. This field will no longer accept the value `TIME_UNIT_LIFETIME`. [Read more about this announced change](/display-video/api/deprecations#features.lifetime_frequency_cap).
  *   `timeUnitCount` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - The number of time_unit the frequency cap will last. Required when unlimited is `false`.
