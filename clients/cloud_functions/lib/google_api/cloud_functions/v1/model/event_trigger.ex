defmodule GoogleApi.CloudFunctions.V1.Model.EventTrigger do
  @moduledoc """
  Describes EventTrigger, used to request events be sent from another
  service.

  ## Attributes

  - eventType (String.t): Required. The type of event to observe. For example:
  `providers/cloud.storage/eventTypes/object.change` and
  `providers/cloud.pubsub/eventTypes/topic.publish`.

  Event types match pattern `providers/*/eventTypes/*.*`.
  The pattern contains:

  1. namespace: For example, `cloud.storage` and
   `google.firebase.analytics`.
  2. resource type: The type of resource on which event occurs. For
   example, the Google Cloud Storage API includes the type `object`.
  3. action: The action that generates the event. For example, action for
   a Google Cloud Storage Object is 'change'.
  These parts are lower case. Defaults to `nil`.
  - failurePolicy (GoogleApi.CloudFunctions.V1.Model.FailurePolicy.t): Specifies policy for failed executions. Defaults to `nil`.
  - resource (String.t): Required. The resource(s) from which to observe events, for example,
  `projects/_/buckets/myBucket`.

  Not all syntactically correct values are accepted by all services. For
  example:

  1. The authorization model must support it. Google Cloud Functions
   only allows EventTriggers to be deployed that observe resources in the
   same project as the `CloudFunction`.
  2. The resource type must match the pattern expected for an
   `event_type`. For example, an `EventTrigger` that has an
   `event_type` of "google.pubsub.topic.publish" should have a resource
   that matches Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics.

  Additionally, some services may support short names when creating an
  `EventTrigger`. These will always be returned in the normalized "long"
  format.

  See each *service's* documentation for supported formats. Defaults to `nil`.
  - service (String.t): The hostname of the service that should be observed.

  If no string is provided, the default service implementing the API will
  be used. For example, `storage.googleapis.com` is the default for all
  event types in the `google.storage` namespace. Defaults to `nil`.
